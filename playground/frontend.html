working with complex GraphQL schemas, it's common to have shared fields across different types. A fragment colocation pattern allows us to define fragments alongside their corresponding components, resulting in a more cohesive and maintainable codebase.\n\nBy colocating fragments, we can easily reuse them across components that share common fields, reducing redundant code and promoting consistency. This can be further enhanced by using other layers of tooling, i.e. converting fragments into Typescript interfaces or auto generating React hooks for queries \u0026 mutations.\n\nThis note aims to discuss such a pattern, made possible with:\n\n- [React](reacthttps/react.dev)\u003e)\n- [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/): Comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. We can use it to fetch, cache, and modify application data, all while automatically updating the UI.\n- [@graphql-codegen/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphql-codegen/cli): Auto generation of typed queries, mutations, subscriptions and typed GraphQL resolvers.\n\nFirst, let's step back \u0026 take a quick look at what is a fragment.\n\n## Fragments\n\nA [GraphQL fragment](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments) is a piece of logic that can be shared between multiple queries and mutations.\n\nHere's the declaration of a `NameParts` fragment that can be used with any `Person` object:\n\n```graphql\nfragment NameParts on Person {\n  firstName\n  lastName\n}\n```\n\nEvery fragment includes a subset of the fields that belong to its associated type. In the above example, the `Person` type must declare `firstName` and `lastName` fields for the `NameParts` fragment to be valid.\n\nWe can now include the `NameParts` fragment in any number of queries and mutations that refer to `Person` objects, like so:\n\n```graphql\nquery GetPerson {\n  people(id: \"7\") {\n    ...NameParts\n    avatar(size: LARGE)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou precede an included fragment with three periods (`...`), much like JavaScript [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax).\n\nBased on our `NameParts` definition, the above query is equivalent to:\n\n```graphql\nquery GetPerson {\n  people(id: \"7\") {\n    firstName\n    lastName\n    avatar(size: LARGE)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf we later *change* which fields are included in the `NameParts` fragment, we automatically change which fields are included in operations that *use* the fragment. This reduces the effort required to keep fields consistent across a set of operations.\n\nThat's it for fragment. Let's move on to how we actually implement a colocation pattern with fragments and React.\n\n## Example: Animal Cards and Lists\n\nLet's consider an example where we're building an application that showcases cats and dogs. We want to implement reusable components to display individual animal cards (`CatCard` and `DogCard`) as well as lists of animals (`CatList` and `DogList`).\n\nFor backend, let's say we are using [NestJS](nestjs-a-progressive-node.js framework](https:/nestjs.com). The schema consists of the following types:\n\n```ts\ninterface AnimalModel {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  bread: string\n}\n\ninterface CatModel extends AnimalModel {\n  age: number\n}\n\ninterface DogModel extends AnimalModel {\n  weight: number\n}\n```\n\nWe'll define fragments for the shared fields (`id`, `name`, and `breed`) within the `AnimalModel` type, and define two other fragments for cat \u0026 dog that extend from the animal fragment:\n\n```jsx\nimport { gql } from '@apollo/client'\n\nconst ANIMAL_FRAGMENT = gql`\n  fragment AnimalFragment on AnimalModel {\n    id\n    name\n    breed\n  }\n`\n\nconst CAT_FRAGMENT = gql`\n  fragment CatFragment on CatModel {\n    ...AnimalFragment\n    age\n  }\n  ${ANIMAL_FRAGMENT}\n`\n\nconst DOG_FRAGMENT = gql`\n  fragment DogFragment on DogModel {\n    ...AnimalFragment\n    weight\n  }\n  ${ANIMAL_FRAGMENT}\n`\n```\n\nBy this point, we are still missing something until we can build the `CatCard` and `DogCard` components - the Typescript types.\n\nWith `@graphql-codegen/cli`, we can convert these fragments into Typescript interfaces by running a CLI script. I will not go into details into how the tool work so you should also give [this link](home-graphql-code-generator-the-guild.dev)](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen)) a look - they provide an interactive example.\n\nBasically `@graphql-codegen/cli` will:\n\n- Call our GraphQL backend to fetch the schema\n- Scan our codebase for query, mutation and fragment definitions to convert\n- Put the output into a file that we have specified\n\nAfter running the CLI, the typing output will look like below:\n\n```ts\n// Output file: graphql/generated.ts\n\nexport type AnimalFragment {\n\t__typename?: 'AnimalModel';\n\tid: Scalars['String'];\n\tname: Scalars['String'];\n\tbread: Scalars['String'];\n}\n\nexport type CatFragment {\n\t__typename?: 'CatModel';\n\tid: Scalars['String'];\n\tname: Scalars['String'];\n\tbread: Scalars['String'];\n\tage: Scalars['Int'];\n}\n\nexport type DogFragment {\n\t__typename?: 'DogModel';\n\tid: Scalars['String'];\n\tname: Scalars['String'];\n\tbread: Scalars['String'];\n\tweight: Scalars['Int'];\n}\n```\n\nNow that we have everything we need, let's build the `CatCard` and `DogCard` components:\n\n```ts\nimport { CatFragment } from 'graphql/generated'\n\n// const ANIMAL_FRAGMENT = gql`...`\n\n// const CAT_FRAGMENT = gql`...`\n\n// const DOG_FRAGMENT = gql`...`\n\nconst CatCard = (props: { cat: CatFragment }) =\u003e {\n  const { cat } = props\n\n  // Component rendering logic\n}\n\nconst DogCard = (props: { cat: DogFragment }) =\u003e {\n  const { cat } = props\n\n  // Component rendering logic\n}\n```\n\nThe properties `cat` and `dog` will have the types we have defined for the fragments they are actually using - an exact map from GraphQL models to Typescript types that we can be sure will always be accurate as long as the fragments we define match the schema from GraphQL backend.\n\nNext, let's build the `CatList` and `DogList` component and see how we handle queries. Let's defined 2 queries to get cats and dogs:\n\n```ts\n// ... import needed stuff\nimport { gql } from '@apollo/client'\n\ngql`\n  query GetCatList {\n    cats {\n      ...CatFragment\n    }\n  }\n  ${CAT_FRAGMENT}\n`\n\ngql`\n  query GetDogList {\n    dogs {\n      ...DogFragment\n    }\n  }\n  ${DOG_FRAGMENT}\n`\n```\n\nThen we run `@graphql-codegen/cli` again. Depending on how we set-up the CLI, output will vary so the below are what I normally work with:\n\n- `useGetCatListQuery`: A hook that fires a request to fetch cat list \u0026 return the data.\n- `useGetCatListQueryLazy`: A hook that returns a function to fetch cat list in case we want to manually get the list.\n- A variety of Typescript types for query document, variables or return result.\n\nCore features of Apollo such as request state management, caching \u0026 revalidating are all functional through these custom hooks.\n\nNow that we have the queries, let's build the `CatList` and `DogList` components:\n\n```ts\n// ... import needed stuff\nimport { useGetCatListQuery, useGetDogListQueryLazy } from 'graphql/generated';\n\nconst CatList = () = {\n\tconst data = useGetCatListQuery();\n\tconst cats = data.data?.cats || [];\n\n\tif (data.loading) {\n\t\treturn null;\n\t}\n\n\treturn cats.map(cat =\u003e \u003cCatCard cat={cat} /\u003e);\n}\n\nconst DogList = () = {\n\tconst [getDogList] = useGetDogListQueryLazy();\n\tconst [dogs, setDogs] = useState\u003cDogFragment[]\u003e([]);\n\n\tuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n\t\tgetDogList().then(res =\u003e setDogs(res.data?.dogs || []));\n\t}, [])\n\n\treturn dogs.map(dog =\u003e \u003cDogCard dog={dog} /\u003e);\n}\n\n```\n\nIn the above code, the `CatList` and `DogList` are using the query hooks generated in the previous step. `CatList` and `DogList` are using `CatCard` and `DogCard` components, while the queries are using `CatFragment` and `DogFragment` defined together with the card components.\n\nAll the types match perfectly.\n\n## The Benefits\n\nThis pattern offers several benefits:\n\n- **Code Reusability:** By defining fragments alongside their respective components, we can reuse the fragments in multiple queries and components. This avoids duplicating field definitions and promotes modular and reusable code.\n- **Consistency:** Colocating fragments ensures that components sharing common fields always use the same fragment definition. This eliminates inconsistencies and makes it easier to maintain and update the codebase.\n- **Readability:** By having fragments colocated with their components, developers can easily understand which fields are being used by a component without having to navigate to a separate file or location.\n- **Overfetching Prevention**: This pattern enforces one of GraphQL core values which is to not overfetch. Children components define what they need through fragments, and \"bubble\" that up to parent components where the queries take place. This make sure that we'll always fetch only what we need.\n- **Automatic, Strict Typing**: Instead of manually defining types for the components, we are using types generated based on the fragments they are consuming. This ensure the types we are using will always map to a valid GraphQL model. Whenever we update a fragment, the corresponding type will also be updated.\n\n## The Disadvantages\n\nWhile the Fragment Colocation Pattern provides several advantages, it's important to consider its limitations:\n\n- **Fragment Duplication:** If fragments are not organized and managed effectively, there is a risk of duplicating fragments across different components. This can lead to maintenance challenges and inconsistencies if modifications are required.\n- **Increased Complexity:** As the number of fragments and components grow, managing and organizing the fragments may become more complex. It's crucial to establish clear conventions and guidelines to keep the codebase manageable.\n- **Inconventional Approach**: Even though this pattern might look clear on paper, it might be challenge when engineers are new to it, especially if they are used to the REST mindset. Most often this pattern (or maybe GraphQL in general) demands engineers to adopt a completely different mindset when looking at building components.\n  - _Personal take:_ _When we bubble types from children to parent, as the component trees grow bigger, it could become harder and harder to trace the fragments back to where they actually begin, especially when we couldn't organize or reuse the components effectively. It's a top-down vs bottom-up way of looking at components. We can quickly find the top, but we might need to dig around for a bit to find the bottom._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe pattern we have discussed provides an effective way to colocate fragments with their corresponding components, while also provides strict typing and other quality-of-life features with extra toolings.\n\nThis pattern enhances code reusability, consistency, and readability. By reusing fragments across components that share common fields, we can avoid duplication and ensure a more maintainable codebase.\n\nOn the other hand, we also need to keep in mind its limitations, such as potential fragment duplication and increased complexity with larger codebases, and a steep learning curve.\n\nAll in all, personally I think this a pattern that's _easy to adopt, hard to master_ (thus also easy to mess up). It's true to the sprit of GraphQL, and worth a try to see for ourselves how it can give us a different approach to building optimized, well-organized code-bases.\n","title":"A Fragment Colocation Pattern with React \u0026 Apollo GraphQL","short_title":"","description":"When working with complex GraphQL schemas, it's common to have shared fields across different types.

Basically, you can say an Atomic CSS framework is a collection of the CSS like these:\n\n```css\n.m-0 {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n.text-red {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nWe have quite a few utilities-first CSS framework like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Windi CSS](https://windicss.org/) and [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/), etc. And there are also some UI libraries that come with some CSS utilities as the complement to the framework, for example [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/api/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/style-props).\n\n## Variations\n\n### Static\n\nSimilar to how we write normal CSS, we define a unit-based design system for spacing, color, typography, etc. Take a look at these default utility classes from Tailwind:\n\n```css\n# 1 unit ~ 0.25rem .m-4 {\n  margin: 1rem;\n}\n\n.m-8 {\n  margin: 2rem;\n}\n```\n\n**Advantages**\n\n- Easy to set up and use.\n- Immutable styles that speak for themselves (by good naming convention).\n\n### Programmatic\n\nThis style involves using a build tool to automatically generate styles based on what it finds in the HTML.\n\nFor example, given this:\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv class=\"Bgc(#0280ae) C(#fff) P(20px)\"\u003eLorem ipsum\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nThe following CSS would be generated:\n\n```css\n.Bgc\\(#0280ae\\) {\n  background-color: #0280ae;\n}\n.C\\(#fff\\) {\n  color: #fff;\n}\n.P\\(20px\\) {\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n```\n\nAnother example would be Tailwind's JIT mode:\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv className=\"bg-[#FFF] font-[24px]\"\u003e...\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n**Advantages**\n\n- Easy to use.\n- Stylesheets generated during the build process are fully optimized with no unused styles.\n- Much more flexible \u0026 spontaneous (... just like inline style).\n\n## Purposes\n\n### Atomic CSS keeps things simple\n\n- Classes are immutable. They only do one thing.\n- Naming is straight forward. It's easy to tell what a class does at a glance.\n- Using a utility class in an HTML file is unambiguous - we know what we are changing, without concern of breaking something, somewhere else.\n- Easy to pick-up without diving too deep into actual stylesheets.\n\n### Atomic CSS keeps things consistent\n\n- Unit-based so styles are consistent \u0026 scalable. Let's look into how Tailwind setup their default styles again:\n  - `m-4 -\u003e margin: 1rem`, `m-8 -\u003e margin: 2rem` -\u003e 1 unit ~ 0.25rem. With this, when we see `m-40`, we can easily deduce that it's `10rem`.\n- Designs that follow an atomic system will be easier for developers to implement.\n  - An offset of 1 or 2 pixels while dragging components around in Figma might be neglectible, but applying those styles to the app will bloat it with \"magic numbers\" that feel random \u0026 irrelevant.\n  - With designers \u0026 developers agreeing on a common styling system, developers still know what they have to use when encountering \"magic numbers\" in the design. They can see a `padding: 63px` and know the designers actually meant `padding: 64px` (divisible by 4).\n\n### Atomic CSS is not inline styles\n\nInline styles have long been deemed a bad practice, and many people dislike Atomic CSS because they think _it shares the same suffer with inline styles_.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n\u003e What if we want to change everything with a `.black` class to be navy instead?\n\nAn easy solution would be finding all instances of `.black` with our Text Editor and replace them manually. However, it's a _tedious_ deed, and exactly what is frowned upon by the community. People value _reusability_.\n\n**But we do have reusability with Atomic CSS** (along with many other things).\n\n#### Reusability\n\nReusability of Atomic CSS comes from the way we use them. With libraries such as React, it's easy to define a _reusable_ component, with all the styles bundled inside. Now changing the color of a widely-used button is a one-line operation:\n\n```jsx\nexport const CommonButton = () =\u003e {\n  return (\n    \u003cbutton type=\"button\" className=\"bg-primary\"\u003e\n      Button\n    \u003c/button\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nCombining with suitable tools, we can make it even more flexibile:\n\n```jsx\nimport { css } from '@linaria/core'\n\nconst reusableButtonClassName = css`\n  @apply p-2 rounded bg-white font-base border-secondary;\n  line-height: 1;\n\n  @screen md {\n    @apply font-xl;\n  }\n`\n\nconst reusableActiveButtonClassName = css`\n  @apply border-primary;\n`\n\nexport const CommonButton = ({ isActive }) =\u003e {\n  return (\n    \u003cbutton type=\"button\" className={['reusableButtonClassName', isActive \u0026\u0026 'reusableActiveButtonClassName']}\u003e\n      Button\n    \u003c/button\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, we are utilizing the strength of both Atomic CSS and [css-in-js]().\n\n#### Abstraction\n\nWith atomic classes, it is possible to create abstractions that would be impossible with inline styles.\n\n```html\n\u003cp style=\"font-family: helvetica; color: rgb(20, 20, 20)\"\u003eInline styles suck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"helvetica rgb202020\"\u003eBadly written CSS isn't very different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"sans-serif color-dark\"\u003eUtility classes allow for abstraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n```\n\nThe first two examples shown above would require a manual find-and-replace in order to update styling were the design to change. The styles in the third example can be adjusted in a single place within a stylesheet.\n\n#### Tooling\n\nSass, Less, PostCSS, Autoprefixer… The CSS community has created a lot of useful tools that weren’t available for inline styles.\n\n#### Brevity\n\nRather than writing out verbose inline styles, atomic classes can be terse abbreviations of declarations. It’s less typing: `mt-0` vs `margin-top: 0`, `flex` vs `display: flex`, etc.\n\n#### Specificity\n\nInline styles have the 2nd highest level of specificity (only less than `!important`) .The lower specificity of atomic classes compared to inline styles is a good thing. It allows more versatility.\n\n#### Possibilities\n\nUtility classes can do things inline styles can't.\n\nInline styles do not support media queries, pseudo selectors, `@supports`, or CSS animations. Perhaps you have a single hover effect you want to apply to disparate elements rather than to only one component.\n\n```css\n.circle {\n  border-radius: 50%;\n}\n\n.hover-radius-0:hover {\n  border-radius: 0;\n}\n```\n\nSimple reusable media query rules can also be turned into a utility class. Its common to use a classname prefix for small, medium and large screen sizes. Here is an example of a flexbox class that will only apply on medium and large screen sizes:\n\n```css\n@media (min-width: 600px) {\n  .md-flex {\n    display: flex;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Atomic CSS is not all or nothing\n\nThere's no doubt CSS utilities can cover a lot of common use-cases, but it's not all we need. There are plenty of cases where utility classes aren’t the best option:\n\n- If you need to change a lot of styles for a particular component inside of a media query.\n- If you want to change multiple styles conditionally during run-time, based on a component's state.\n\nRefer back to [this section](#Reusability) for a sample scenario. Utility classes can coexist with other approaches. It's just a good idea to define base styles and sane defaults globally.\n\n## References\n\n- https://antfu.me/posts/reimagine-atomic-css\n- https://css-tricks.com/growing-popularity-atomic-css/\n- https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/\n","title":"An Introduction to Atomic CSS","short_title":"","description":"This article provides an overview of Atomic CSS, including its definition, variations, purposes, and how it compares to other CSS approaches.","tags":["frontend","css","atomic-css"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["mashiro5951"],"date":"Thu Oct 13 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/an-introduction-to-atomic-css.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","an-introduction-to-atomic-css"]},{"content":"\n## Introduction\n\nMock Service Worker (MSW) is an API mocking library that leverages the Service Worker API to intercept requests. It offers unique features that set it apart from traditional mocking libraries, making it a go-to choice for developers. With MSW, you can seamlessly mock both RESTful and GraphQL APIs, providing flexibility for various API architectures. Additionally, MSW supports both Node.js and browser environments, enabling consistent API mocking across different parts of your application. Let's explore how MSW empowers developers to reliable web applications by seamlessly working in both Node.js and browser environments\n\n## Applying MSW for API Interception in Development\n\nMSW operates client-side by using a Service Worker to intercept requests. However, we don't have to write any of the worker's code by ourselves, but rather copy the worker file distributed by the library. This CLI will help us to do that\n\n```bash\nnpx msw init \u003cPUBLIC_DIR\u003e --save\n```\n\nTo configure the worker:\n\n```js\n// src/mocks/browser.js\nimport { setupWorker } from 'msw'\nimport { handlers } from './handlers' // list of request handlers\n\n// This configures a Service Worker with the given request handlers.\nexport const worker = setupWorker(...handlers)\n```\n\nTo start the worker:\n\n```js\n// src/index.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\nimport App from './App'\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {\n  const { worker } = require('./mocks/browser')\n  worker.start()\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\u003cApp /\u003e, document.getElementById('root'))\n```\n\nLet's consider a scenario where we have an `App` component, as shown in the code snippet below. This component makes an API request, which may not be fully implemented on the backend side, or we might want to test how our component handles in different response data or error responses\n\n```js\n// src/App.js\nfunction App() {\n  const { data, error } = useFetch('https:/example.com/api/usage')\n  if (error) {\n    return \u003cdiv className=\"error\"\u003e{error.message}\u003c/div\u003e\n  }\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"App\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003eAPI mocking example\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e{data.firstName}\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNow, we can mock api response by adding MSW handlers\n\n```js\n// src/mocks/handlers.js\nimport { rest } from 'msw'\n\nexport const handlers = [\n  //respond with mock data\n  rest.get('https:/example.com/api/usage', (req, res, ctx) =\u003e {\n    return res(\n      ctx.status(301),\n      ctx.json({\n        id: 1,\n        firstName: 'Dwarves',\n      }),\n    )\n  }),\n  // Alternatively, throw an error\n  rest.get('https:/example.com/api/usage', (req, res, ctx) =\u003e {\n    return res(ctx.status(500), ctx.json({ message: 'Internal Server Error' }))\n  }),\n]\n```\n\nThis allows us to verify that our component behaves correctly and handles various API responses or errors gracefully, even if the backend is not fully implemented or we want to test different scenarios without relying on the actual API response.\n\n## Applying MSW for React Testing\n\nOne of the most common use cases for MSW is leveraging its request handlers for integration tests. MSW allows you to seamlessly incorporate mocking into any Node process To configure the server:\n\n```js\n// src/mocks/server.js\nimport { setupServer } from 'msw/node'\nimport { handlers } from './handlers'\n\n// This configures a request mocking server with the given request handlers.\nexport const server = setupServer(...handlers)\n```\n\nBefore running your test, start the MSW server:\n\n```js\nbeforeAll(() =\u003e server.listen())\n```\n\nAfter each test, make sure to clean up by stopping the server and resetting any request handlers that were added on runtime:\n\n```js\nafterEach(() =\u003e {\n  server.resetHandlers()\n  cleanup()\n})\n\nafterAll(() =\u003e server.close())\n```\n\nBasic example of an integration test over the `App` component.\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport App from './App'\n\ntest('passes', async () =\u003e {\n  render(\u003cApp /\u003e)\n\n  expect(\n    // Expect the mocked response to be present in the DOM.\n    await screen.findByText(`Dwarves`),\n  ).toBeInTheDocument()\n})\n```\n\nyou also can add additional handlers during runtime to handle different scenarios in different tests. Here's an example:\n\n```js\ntest('handle error responses', async () =\u003e {\n  render(\u003cApp /\u003e)\n  // a runtime handler which\n  server.use(\n    rest.get('https:/example.com/api/usage', (req, res, ctx) =\u003e {\n      return res(ctx.json({ message: 'Internal Server Error' }))\n    }),\n  )\n  const errorElement = screen.getByText('Internal Server Error', { className: 'error' })\n  expect(errorElement).toBeInTheDocument()\n})\n```\n\nThe `server.use` function allows us to add a runtime handler to our mock server. However, it's important to note that any handlers added in runtime will be removed when `server.resetHandlers()` is called.\n\n## Reference\n\n- [Mocking API Servers with Mock Service Worker (MSW)](https://blog.openreplay.com/mocking-api-servers-with-mock-service-worker-msw/)\n- [MSW Documentation](https://mswjs.io/docs/)\n","title":"Applying Mock Service Worker (MSW) for Seamless Web Development","short_title":"","description":"Mock Service Worker (MSW) is an API mocking library that leverages the Service Worker API to intercept requests.

As a result, we can design systems that encourage consistency and scalability while also displaying information in its final context. Additionally, by putting a system together rather than taking it apart, we avoid picking out the best patterns later.\n- The method fits incredibly well with component-based architectures like React, Vue,...\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThere are 5 distinct levels of atomic design which are: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.\n\n![](assets/atomic-design-pattern_atom-design-structure.webp)\n\n### Atoms\n\n- Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. When applied to web interfaces, they are our `HTML` tags like an `input` or a `button`.\n- These are fairly abstract elements which are often not useful on their own but are good references in the context of a pattern if seen on a bigger picture.\n\n![](assets/atomic-design-pattern_atom-atomic-design.webp)\n\n**Molecules**\n\nJust like in chemistry, molecules are a set of atoms combined. This could include a form input with a title and input standing next to each other or a header containing multiple atoms like icons, buttons, or inputs.\n\n![](assets/atomic-design-pattern_molecule-atomic-design.webp)\n\n### Organisms\n\nMolecules give us some functional building blocks to work with, and they are a sub-set of organisms. Molecules when joined together create organisms which is a relatively complex and distinct section of an interface.\n\n![](assets/atomic-design-pattern_organisms-atomic-design.webp)\n\n### Templates\n\nTemplates consist mostly of groups of organisms to form pages, keep in mind that these template doesn't contain data and only contain props.\n\nTemplates begin their life as HTML wireframes, but over time become the final deliverable.\n\nt this stage we can really see the design coming together and making more sense for the clients to see the layout of the interface before finalizing it.\n\n![](assets/atomic-design-pattern_template-atomic-design.webp)\n\n### Pages\n\nPages are specific instances of templates. Here, placeholder content is replaced with real representative content to give an accurate depiction of what a user will ultimately see.\n\n![](assets/atomic-design-pattern_page-atomic-design.webp)\n\n### Atomic design folder structure\n\nThis is an example of an application folder structure using atomic design, as you can see there are 5 distinct layers and you can organize them in anyway you want following your own preference.\n\n![](assets/atomic-design-pattern_folder-structure-atomic-design.webp)\n\n## Reference\n\n- https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#atoms\n- https://andela.com/insights/structuring-your-react-application-atomic-design-principles/\n- https://blog.ippon.tech/atomic-design-in-practice/\n","title":"Atomic Design Pattern","short_title":"","description":"Atomic design is a methodology for crafting design systems with five key fundamental building blocks, which, when combined, promote consistency, modularity, and scalability.","tags":["frontend","atomic-design"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["Tran Hoang Nam"],"date":"Wed Jun 15 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/atomic-design-pattern.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","atomic-design-pattern"]},{"content":"\nLet's say we want to create a `Text` component with React and Typescript. A basic implementation could look like:\n\n```typescript\nimport React from 'react'\n\ntype TextProps = {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'\n  color?: 'default' | 'primary' | 'secondary'\n  className?: string\n}\n\nconst Text = ({ children, className, size, color }: TextProps) =\u003e {\n  // hooks to return CSS class base on component props\n  const classes = useGetClasses('Text', { size, color })\n\n  return \u003cp className={clsx(classes, className)}\u003e{children}\u003c/p\u003e\n}\n```\n\nThis component works for simple use-cases but if we care about semantic HTML (use HTML heading tags to display titles or subtitles, `\u003cp/\u003e` for paragraph) it doesn't help. We need to adjust the above implementation by adding a `as` (you can name it anything you like) property to determine which tag we want to render.\n\n```typescript\ntype TextProps = {\n    children: React.ReactNode\n    as?: any // We don't know the type of this property yet\n}\n\nconst Text = ({ children, as, ...rest }: TextProps) =\u003e {\n    // other code\n    ...\n\n    const Component = as || 'p';\n\n    return (\n        \u003cComponent {...rest}\u003e{children}\u003c/Component\u003e\n    )\n}\n\n// Usage\n// display with h1 tag\n\u003cText as='h1'\u003eTitle\u003c/Text\u003e\n// display with p tag\n\u003cText as='p'\u003eLong paragraph\u003c/Text\u003e\n```\n\nOur `Text` component works as expected but these are some couple of issues:\n\n- `as` property is `any` so we can pass anything we want even invalid tag.\n- We want to pass more attributes which belong to the HTML tag we provide\n\n```typescript\n\u003cText as=\"label\" htmlFor=\"username\"\u003e\n  Username\n\u003c/Text\u003e\n```\n\nTo fix the first issue, we need `as` only accepts a valid React element type. Fortunately, we can achieve this by using : `React.ElementType`. Update the implementation:\n\n```typescript\nimport React from 'react';\n\ntype TextProps\u003cC extends React.ElementType\u003e = {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  as?: C;\n  // other properties\n};\n\nconst Text = \u003cC extends React.ElementType\u003e({ children, as }: TextProps\u003cC\u003e) =\u003e {\n  // other code\n    ...\n\n  const Component = as || 'p';\n\n  return \u003cComponent\u003e{children}\u003c/Component\u003e;\n};\n```\n\nNow typescript will complain if you try to pass an invalid html tag\n\n```typescript\n// It's ok\n\u003cText as='p'\u003eHello world\u003c/Text\u003e\n// Error!!!! Type '\"vincenzo\"' is not assignable to type 'ElementType\u003cany\u003e | undefined'\n\u003cText as='vincenzo'\u003eHello world\u003c/Text\u003e\n```\n\nTo solve second issue, once again, React provides us a useful type `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef`.\n\n```typescript\ntype TextProps\u003cC extends React.ElementType\u003e = {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  as?: C\n} \u0026 React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef\u003cC\u003e\n```\n\nEssentially, the type of `TextProps` is an object type containing `children`, `as` and all valid component properties that correlates with `as` tag.\n\nNow, let’s give the solution a try! We try to add `htmlFor` property to a `Text` component with `as` is `p`. That’s wrong, and righty caught by TypeScript with the error: `Property 'htmlFor' does not exist on type...`\n\n```typescript\n// It's ok\n\u003cText as='label' htmlFor='username'\u003e\n    Username\n\u003c/Text\u003e\n// Error!!!! Property 'htmlFor' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes \u0026 { children: ReactNode; as?: \"p\" | undefined; }....\n\u003cText as='p' htmlFor='username'\u003e\n    Username\n\u003c/Text\u003e\n```\n\nOur component is looking good right now but we still have an issue. The `as` property is optional, if we omit it, the component will render as `p` tag (as we expected) but Typescript can't know about this so it can't check the valid properties for this component.\n\n```typescript\n// No error !!! But it should be\n\u003cText htmlFor=\"username\"\u003eUser\u003c/Text\u003e\n```\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to assign a default type for type parameters in a generic type.\n\n```typescript\nconst Text = \u003cC extends React.ElementType = 'p' /* default type */\u003e({\n  children,\n  as,\n  ...rest\n}: TextProps\u003cC\u003e) =\u003e {\n  // other code\n   ...\n\n  const Component = as || 'p';\n\n  return \u003cComponent {...rest}\u003e{children}\u003c/Component\u003e;\n};\n```\n\nThe previous example we had should now throw an error, that is when you pass `htmlFor` to the `Text` component without an `as` prop. It's magic. ✨✨\n\nWe still can improve our `Text` component. As we know, some html tags have some internal properties like `color`, if we want to provide our own `color` property (or other properties), we just don't want to mess it up. We need to filter our own properties out of internal properties.\n\n```typescript\n// our custom text properties\ntype Props {\n    color?: 'primary' | 'secondary',\n    size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'\n}\n// omit internal properties\nOmit\u003cReact.ComponentPropsWithoutRef\u003cC\u003e, keyOf Props\u003e\n```\n\nThe full implementation looks like\n\n```typescript\ntype Props\u003cC extends React.ElementType\u003e = {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  as?: C;\n  color?: 'primary' | 'secondary';\n  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';\n  // other properties...\n};\n\ntype TextProps\u003cC extends React.ElementType\u003e = Props\u003cC\u003e \u0026\n  Omit\u003cReact.ComponentPropsWithoutRef\u003cC\u003e, keyof Props\u003cC\u003e\u003e;\n\nconst Text = \u003cC extends React.ElementType = 'p'\u003e({\n  children,\n  as,\n  ...rest\n}: TextProps\u003cC\u003e) =\u003e {\n  // other code\n    ...\n\n  const Component = as || 'p';\n\n  return \u003cComponent {...rest}\u003e{children}\u003c/Component\u003e;\n};\n```\n\nOur `Text` component is strongly typed.\n\nNow, let's take it one step further. We want our solution works for other components not only `Text`. To make our solution reuseable, we can add one more generic type which represent the custom component.\n\nBefore going ahead, follow the `separation of concerns` principle, we should move `as` property out of our custom properties and define its own type.\n\n```\ntype AsProp\u003cC extends React.ElementType\u003e = {\n  as?: C;\n};\n```\n\nOur reuseable solution will look like\n\n```typescript\ntype AsProp\u003cC extends React.ElementType\u003e = {\n  as?: C\n}\n\ntype PropWithAs\u003cC extends React.ElementType, P = {}\u003e = P \u0026 AsProp\u003cC\u003e\n\nexport type PolymorphicComponentProps\u003c\n  C extends React.ElementType,\n  Props = {}, // adding one more generic type\n\u003e = PropWithAs\u003cC, Props\u003e \u0026 Omit\u003cReact.ComponentPropsWithoutRef\u003cC\u003e, keyof PropWithAs\u003cC, Props\u003e\u003e\n```\n\nNow we can go ahead and use `PolymorphicComponentProps` on our components as follows:\n\n```typescript\n// Text component\ntype TextProps = {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  color?: 'primary' | 'secondary';\n  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';\n // other properties...\n};\n\nconst Text = \u003cC extends React.ElementType = 'p'\u003e({\n  children,\n  as,\n  ...rest\n}: PolymorphicComponentProps\u003cC, TextProps\u003e) =\u003e {\n    // other code\n    ...\n\n  const Component = as || 'p';\n\n  return \u003cComponent {...rest}\u003e{children}\u003c/Component\u003e;\n};\n\n// Usage\n\u003cText as='h1'\u003eHeading\u003c/Text\u003e\n\u003cText as='label' htmlFor='username'\u003e\nUsername\n\u003c/Text\u003e\n\n// Button component\ntype ButtonProps = {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  color?: 'primary' | 'secondary';\n  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';\n // other properties...\n};\n\nconst Button = \u003cC extends React.ElementType = 'button'\u003e({\n  children,\n  as,\n  ...rest\n}: PolymorphicComponentProps\u003cC, ButtonProps\u003e) =\u003e {\n    // other code\n    ...\n\n  const Component = as || 'button';\n\n  return \u003cComponent {...rest}\u003e{children}\u003c/Component\u003e;\n};\n\n// Usage\n\u003cButton\u003eSubmit\u003c/Text\u003e\n\u003cButton as='a' href='/login'\u003eLogin\u003c/Text\u003e // act as a link\n\n```\n\nEverything works like a charm. ✨✨\n\n## How about `ref`?\n\nTo write a functional component which support Ref forwarding, we can use `React.forwardRef` function. The `Button` component will be look like\n\n```typescript\nconst Button = React.forwardRef\u003cHTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps\u003e((props, ref) =\u003e {\n  const { children, ...rest } = props\n\n  return (\n    \u003cbutton ref={ref} {...rest}\u003e\n      {children}\n    \u003c/button\u003e\n  )\n})\n```\n\nTo create polymorphic component, we need to replace `HTMLButtonElement` with a generic type `C`. Unfortunately we can't do that, `forwardRef()` is a function call so we can't define a generic type. So we came up with defining type for the function inside `forwardRef()`.\n\n```typescript\nconst Button = React.forwardRef(\n  \u003cC extends React.ElementType = 'button'\u003e(\n    props: PolymorphicComponentProps\u003cC, ButtonProps\u003e,\n    ref: unknown, // we still don't know yet\n  ) =\u003e {\n    const { as, children, ...rest } = props\n    const Component = as || 'button'\n    return (\n      \u003cComponent ref={ref} {...rest}\u003e\n        {children}\n      \u003c/Component\u003e\n    )\n  },\n)\n```\n\nSo what type of the`ref` object? Remember this guy `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef`? he has a brother named `React.ComponentPropsWithRef` which includes all the relevant component props based on the element type, plus the ref object. Let's define a new helper type, `PolymorphicRef`, that returns the type of the ref object for the polymorphic component.\n\n```typescript\ntype PolymorphicRef\u003cC extends React.ElementType\u003e = React.ComponentPropsWithRef\u003cC\u003e['ref']\n\nconst Button = React.forwardRef(\u003cC extends React.ElementType = 'button'\u003e(props: PolymorphicComponentProps\u003cC, ButtonProps\u003e, ref: PolymorphicRef\u003cC\u003e) =\u003e {\n  const { as, children, ...rest } = props\n  const Component = as || 'button'\n  return (\n    \u003cComponent ref={ref} {...rest}\u003e\n      {children}\n    \u003c/Component\u003e\n  )\n})\n```\n\nOur `Button` component still isn't strongly typed. We need to explicitly defined the type annotation for it. `Button` component will be receive `ButtonProps` and return a JSX\n\n```typescript\ntype ButtonComponent = (props: ButtonProps) =\u003e React.ReactElement | null\n```\n\nThe final step is to update `ButtonProp` to support `PolymorphicRef`\n\n```typescript\n// new helper type which includes the `ref` property for the polymorphic component\ntype PolymorphicComponentPropsWithRef\u003c\n  C extends React.ElementType,\n  Props = {}\n\u003e\n = PolymorphicComponentProps\u003cC, Props\u003e \u0026 { ref?: PolymorphicRef\u003cC\u003e }\n\ntype CustomButtonProps = {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  color?: 'primary' | 'secondary';\n  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';\n};\n\ntype ButtonProps\u003cC extends React.ElementType\u003e = PolymorphicComponentPropsWithRef\u003c\n  C,\n  CustomButtonProps\n\u003e\n\ntype ButtonComponent = \u003cC extends React.ElementType = 'button'\u003e(\n  props: ButtonProps\u003cC\u003e,\n) =\u003e React.ReactElement | null\n\nconst Button: ButtonComponent = React.forwardRef(\n  \u003cC extends React.ElementType = 'button'\u003e(\n    props: ButtonProps\u003cC\u003e,\n    ref: PolymorphicRef\u003cC\u003e\n  ) =\u003e {\n    const { as, children, ...rest } = props;\n\n    const Component = as || 'button';\n    return (\n      \u003cComponent ref={ref} {...rest}\u003e\n        {children}\n      \u003c/Component\u003e\n    );\n  }\n);\n\n// Useage\nconst buttonRef1 = React.useRef\u003cHTMLButtonElement | null\u003e(null);\nconst buttonRef2 = React.useRef\u003cHTMLDivElement | null\u003e(null);\n\n// It's ok\n\u003cButton ref={buttonRef1}\u003eButton1\u003c/Button\u003e\n// Error!!!!

This means that developers, translators, and product owners work together in a continuous cycle to ensure that all translations are up-to-date and aligned with the latest software developments.\n\nUnlike traditional translation workflows, Continuous Translation eliminates the need for file and space synchronization between different stakeholders, streamlining the translation process and promoting better collaboration. By implementing Continuous Translation, companies can achieve faster development cycles, higher-quality translations, and a better user experience for their customers.\n\n## Working with localization\n\n### How localization generally works\n\n![](assets/continuous-translation_0ca3440b9dbd840d349d587dd7fd6a1d_md5.webp)\n\nThe classical or typical approach in any software project will have translated data be coupled with the repository (plus its software release) and its access to the data. This data could exist in a database or directly as a file. Changes to the data would be dependent on the coupling of the git repository and the translation management system, which becomes a blocker for translation teams.\n\n### Alternative solutions to localization\n\nIn order to reduce the friction between the developing team and the translation team, we can remove data and process coupling between systems of both teams by centralizing the data to allow for continuous translation. In this article we’ll discuss 2 possible solutions to integrate continuous translation into our current system:\n\n- **Solution 1**: implement an ad-hoc solution ourselves with help from Google Sheets (using Google Translator under the hood).\n- **Solution 2**: translation as a service - we use a third party service for manage our translations.\n\n### Solution 1: Google Sheets\n\nGoogle Sheets is a free and easy-to-use tool that allows us to manage translations with all stakeholders. Before deploying the app, developers can use Git actions to fetch the latest version of the Google Sheets and generate the locale translation files.\n\nHere are what the steps to use Google Sheets would look like for managing translations:\n\n**Step 1:** Create a Google Sheet that contains all supported translation items. Here is an example **[template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jjVDCMAmS6WySmB7L25yNCZX-X3jEwrrqLhqOBzVEs0/edit?usp=sharing)** you can use. **Step 2:** Fetch data from Google Sheets using the following code:\n\n_Make sure to replace the _`***sheetId***`_ and _`***sheetName***`_ with your own values_\n\n```javascript\n// Save on './public/spreadsheet.ts' file\nconst sheetId = '\u003cSheet-ID\u003e'\nconst sheetName = '\u003csheet-name\u003e'\nconst baseUrl = `https://opensheet.elk.sh/${sheetId}/${sheetName}`\n\n// Path to store all translation data\nconst translateDataPath = './public/locales/translate-data.json'\n\nexport const getJsonData = async () =\u003e {\n  const res = await fetch(baseUrl, {\n    method: 'GET',\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      accept: '*/*',\n      authority: 'opensheet.elk.sh',\n    },\n    mode: 'cors',\n    credentials: 'omit',\n  })\n\n  if (res.ok) {\n    return await res.json()\n  }\n}\n\ngetJsonData().then((data) =\u003e {\n  const fs = require('fs')\n  let myObject = data\n\n  // Writing to our JSON file\n  var newData = JSON.stringify(myObject, null, 2)\n  fs.writeFile(translateDataPath, newData, (err) =\u003e {\n    // Error checking\n    if (err) throw err\n    console.log('New data added')\n  })\n})\n```\n\n**Step 3: **After having obtaining the translation data, generate locale files for supported languages using the following code:\n\n```javascript\n// Save on './public/manage-translations.ts' file\nimport path from \"path\";\nimport fs from \"node:fs/promises\";\nimport fsExtra from \"fs-extra\";\nimport _ from \"lodash\";\n\nimport dotenv from \"dotenv\";\ndotenv.config({ path: \".env.local\" });\ndotenv.config({ path: `.env.${process.env.NODE_ENV}` });\ndotenv.config();\n\nconst validLang = [\"en-US\", \"de-DE\", \"fr-FR\"];\nconst defaultLanguage =\n\tprocess.env.LOCALE == null ? \"en-US\" : validLang.includes(process.env.LOCALE) ? process.env.LOCALE : \"en-US\";\n\nconst configs = {\n\tdefaultLanguage,\n\totherLanguages: validLang.filter((lang) =\u003e lang !== defaultLanguage),\n\trootExportPath: \"./public/locales\",\n};\n\nconst allLocales = [];\n\nasync function generateJSONFiles() {\n\tconst data = await fs.readFile(\"./public/locales/translate-data.json\", \"utf8\");\n\tconst jsonData = JSON.parse(data);\n\tconst locales = Object.keys(jsonData[0]).filter((key) =\u003e key !== \"elementId\");\n\tconst result = locales.map((locale) =\u003e {\n\t\tconst data = {};\n\t\tjsonData.forEach((item) =\u003e {\n\t\t\tdata[item.elementId] =\n```\n\n### Solution 2: Use a translation management platform\n\nFor this approach, we can use [Locize](https://locize.com/) as our continuous localization management platform. This approach isn’t limited to Locize, but the idea is to have a platform to decouple software release from the translation work and minimize work friction for translation.\n\n![](assets/continuous-translation_5d971ebb8af780ed2ad9e7626daf0d8c_md5.webp)\n\nLocize has integration support for a variety of frontend systems. You can integrate Locize by following steps:\n\n- Follow [https://docs.locize.com/integration/getting-started](https://docs.locize.com/integration/getting-started) to create a Locize account and project.\n- After the project is created, we will have `project id` and `api key`.\n- Use [https://github.com/locize/locize-cli](https://github.com/locize/locize-cli) to synchronize the existing translations with Locize\n\nThere are three ways to use `Locize` in your app:\n\n- **Approach 1**: Use Locize live download on the client-side only. This option involves bundling translations in your app to prevent an elevated amount of downloads on the server-side. Before deploying your app, synchronize your translations with Locize so that they are bundled in your app. This way, your server-side will not generate any downloads to the Locize CDN during runtime, but only on the client-side.\n- **Approach 2:** Configure Locize to download translations live on both client (browser) and server (node.js).\n\n\u003e Do not use this option if you have a `serverless environment` as it can generate too many download requests and run up your bill.\n\n- **Approach 3:** Bundle translations with your app. This option involves bundling translations in your app at build time. It's recommended to use this option if you have a small number of translations or if your translations don't change frequently.\n\n### Comparisons between solutions\n\n**Solution 1** recommends using a custom translation file and providing translations for each language in a separate JSON file. The translation file is then loaded on the server side and used to render the content in the appropriate language. This solution is relatively simple and straightforward to implement, but it can become cumbersome to manage as the number of languages and translations grows.\n\n**Solution 2** proposes using a translation management platform, with one example using Locize, which allows for continuous localization management. This solution involves integrating Locize into the application, synchronizing the existing translations with Locize, and then bundling the translations in the application using one of three different possibilities, depending on the specific use case. This solution requires more setup and configuration but can provide a more scalable and streamlined approach to managing translations.\n\nIn summary, `Solution 1` is a simpler and cheaper approach to manage translations, while `Solution 2` is a more advanced solution that provides more flexibility and scalability in managing translations.\n\n### Pros and cons when integrating Continuous Translation into your app\n\n**Pros**\n\n- **Faster development cycles**: With Continuous Translation, developers and translators work together in a continuous cycle, ensuring that translations are updated in real-time as new features are developed. This leads to faster development cycles and quicker time-to-market.\n- **Improved translation quality**: Continuous Translation promotes better collaboration between developers and translators, which can lead to higher-quality translations that accurately reflect the intended meaning of the original content.\n- **Better alignment between teams**: By eliminating file and space synchronization issues, Continuous Translation helps to align developers, translators, and product owners more closely, reducing communication errors and promoting better collaboration.\n- **Reduced costs**: Traditional translation workflows can be time-consuming and costly. By streamlining the translation process, Continuous Translation can help to reduce translation costs and improve return on investment.\n\n**Cons**\n\n- **Requires significant coordination**: Continuous Translation requires a high level of coordination between different teams, including developers, translators, and product owners. This can be challenging to manage, particularly for larger projects.\n- **Potential for errors**: Continuous Translation requires real-time updates to translations, which can increase the risk of errors and miscommunication. This requires careful management and quality control.\n- **Requires specialized tools**: Implementing Continuous Translation requires specialized tools and technologies, which can add to the overall cost of the project.\n- **Not suitable for all projects**: Continuous Translation may not be suitable for all projects, particularly those with limited budgets or resources. Traditional translation workflows may be more appropriate for smaller projects or those with less frequent updates.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMultilingual support is a very important function for web or mobile applications nowadays. Users will come from all over the world and always ask for support for their language. The two options above have different advantages and disadvantages, so you need to consider the exact scope of the product to have the best choice for your team. Both methods can meet the needs of constantly translating products to support new features or new products, but it will cost production as well as quality assurance.\n","title":"Continuous Translation","short_title":"","description":"Continuous Translation (CT) is a modern approach to translation management that involves synchronizing software development and translation workflows.

However, media queries have some limitations. For example, we cannot use them to style individual components based on their parent's width; we can only adjust the entire page. This is problematic because we cannot create responsive components; only responsive pages.\n\n## What is Container Queries?\n\nThe CSS3 property \"container queries\" allows us to style elements based on the size of a container. It is similar to a Media Query, except it evaluates against the size of a container instead of the size of the viewport.\n\n## How to use Container Queries?\n\nTo query a component based on its parent width, we need to use the `container-type` property with possible values: `size`, `inline-size`, `block-size`, `style`, `state`.\n\n```css\n.sidebar {\n  container-type: inline-size;\n}\n```\n\nNow we can start to query a container using `@container`. This will query the nearest containment context.\n\n```css\n@container (min-width: 300px) {\n  .content {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally, Containers can be named with `container-name` property. This allows us to query a specific container.\n\n```css\n.sidebar {\n  container-type: inline-size;\n  container-name: my-sidebar;\n}\n```\n\nor shorthand syntax\n\n```css\n.sidebar {\n  container: my-sidebar / inline-size;\n}\n```\n\nThen, to query a specific container, we can use `@container` with `container-name`.\n\n```css\n@container my-sidebar (min-width: 300px) {\n  .content {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Browser Support\n\nCurrently, Container Queries is only available in [modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=Container%20Queries):\n\n- Chrome 105+\n- Safari 15+\n- Edge 105+\n\nUniversal support can be achieved by using [Polyfill](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/container-query-polyfill).\n\n## Reference\n\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries\n- https://javascript.plainenglish.io/css-container-queries-3393fbeb6ea8\n- https://ishadeed.com/article/container-queries-are-finally-here/\n- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/container-queries/\n","title":"CSS Container Queries","short_title":"","description":"Container Queries is a CSS feature that allows us to style elements based on the size of a container.","tags":["frontend","CSS","guides","responsive-design"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["cor3.co"],"date":"Fri Sep 02 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/css-container-queries.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","css-container-queries"]},{"content":"\n**CSS-in-JS** is a styling technique where Javascript is used to style the component. These are multiple implementations of this concept in the form of libraries such as [emotion](https://emotion.sh), [styled-component](https://styled-components.com/), [JSS](https://cssinjs.org). They aim to tackle the limitations of CSS, such as lack of dynamic functionality, scoping, and portability.\n\n## Benefits\n\n### Scoping\n\nWith CSS-in-JS, writing new styles cannot affect anything else in other places on the site, so there’s no need to worry about writing a style that has bad or unintended consequences elsewhere due to a selector in the global scope.\n\n### Avoid naming collisions\n\n[Naming is hard](https://hilton.org.uk/blog/why-naming-things-is-hard). CSS-in-JS libraries automatically generate unique selectors for what’s being styled. We don't need to think about naming.\n\n### Dynamic Functionality\n\nAs CSS-in-JS is essentially JavaScript code, you can apply complex logic to your style rules, such as loops, conditionals, variables, state-based styling, and more.\n\n### Dead code elimination\n\nCSS-in-JS helps with removing dead code. The only styles that are loaded are the styles for the components in use at any given time. There’s no shipping of any unused styles. When a component dies, so does its style.\n\n### Developer ergonomics\n\nIt can be nice to have styles in the same file (or otherwise very close to) the component itself. In the same way, some developers feel very comfortable in JSX. Also, being able to style things without any scoping worry means developers may feel empowered about styling rather than intimidated by it.\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n### Runtime cost\n\nWhen CSS is generated from JavaScript at runtime, in the browser, there is an inherent overhead. Some CSS-in-JS libraries try to overcome this overhead by extracting CSS files during the build time (like [linaria](https://linaria.dev)), but it comes with other [trade-offs](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/2377)\n\n### Learning curve\n\nCSS-in-JS definitely has a learning curve, especially if you have used neither component-based frameworks nor web components before. Besides learning the new syntax, you also need to pick up a new way of thinking, which needs time and might slow down your development workflow for a while.\n\n### Unreadable class names\n\nAutomatically generated selectors significantly worsen code readability. This can be a huge concern for you if you regularly use your browser’s developer tools for debugging. Currently, many CSS-in-JS libraries try to provide meaningful class names based on the declaration name or component name in development mode. Some of them even let you customize the class name generator function. In production mode, though, the class names are still hard to read and debug.\n\n### Extra bundle size\n\nAdding another library to a web page increases the page size, which can negatively impact page load time.\n\n## Reference\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS-in-JS\n- https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-css-in-js-examples-pros-and-cons--cms-33574\n- https://medium.com/dailyjs/what-is-actually-css-in-js-f2f529a2757\n- https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/2377\n","title":"CSS in JS","short_title":"","description":"CSS-in-JS is a styling technique where Javascript is used to style the component.","tags":["frontend","css-in-js"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["khacvy"],"date":"Thu Aug 11 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/css-in-js.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","css-in-js"]},{"content":"\nThe dark mode feature uses local storage to store a user's preference for future usage. The problem is that when the dark mode is enabled and the page is reloaded, there's a flicker of white background all over the page before it turns dark. This happens for a fraction of a second and doesn't look natural.\n\nFollowing is the implementation we normally do when setting up this feature. This works by detecting if the dark mode is enabled from `localStorage` and adding a CSS class called `dark` to the `\u003chtml\u003e` tag so all elements that are descendants of that element will turn to dark styling.\n\n```html\n\u003chtml\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    ...\n    \u003clink href=\"./light.css\" /\u003e\n    \u003clink href=\"./dark.css\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    ...\n    \u003cscript src=\"./main.js\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n```js\n// main.js\n//...\nif (window.localStorage.getItem('theme') === 'dark') {\n  document.documentElement.classList.add('dark')\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the dark styling is only applied if the `main.js` file is called so it will be expected to see the flash of light styling.\n\nTo fix this, put the scripts inside the `\u003chead\u003e` tag, even before the `\u003clink\u003e` or `\u003cstyle\u003e` tags:\n\n```html\n\u003chtml\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\"\u003e\n      if (window.localStorage.getItem('theme') === 'dark') {\n        document.documentElement.classList.add('dark')\n      }\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n    ...\n    \u003clink href=\"./light.css\" /\u003e\n    \u003clink href=\"./dark.css\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    ...\n    \u003cscript src=\"./main.js\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nBy doing this, the page rendering will be blocked when the engine detects the `\u003cscript\u003e` inside the `\u003chead\u003e` tag. While the renderer is idle, the JavaScript interpreter will assign the `dark` value to the CSS class list of `\u003chtml\u003e` before the `dark.css` is loaded.\n\n## Reference\n\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63033412/dark-mode-flickers-a-white-background-for-a-millisecond-on-reload\n","title":"Dark mode flickers a white background for a fraction of a second","short_title":"","description":"The dark mode feature uses local storage to store a user's preference for future usage.

This component is known as the browser engine.\n\nThe browser engine is a fundamental element present in all major web browsers, and various browser manufacturers give their engines distinct names. For instance, Firefox's browser engine is known as [Gecko](https/enwikipedia.org/wiki/gecko_software)\u003e), while Chrome uses [Blink](https/enwikipedia.org/wiki/blink_browser_engine)\u003e), a derivative of [WebKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit).\n\n## From raw bytes of HTML to DOM\n\nWe are all familiar with the term **Document Object Model** or DOM, but it's always helpful to revisit how this crucial component is constructed: It starts with **bytes** of data that the browser reads from the HTML files, which are then transformed into readable **characters**.\n\nBut that bunch of text doesn't produce an actual website. Those characters are parsed into **tokens**, such as the start or end HTML tags, the content characters and so on. The browser then organizes those tokens into **nodes**, and assembles into the hierarchical structure known as the DOM.\n\n\u003e Check out this article for a more detailed understanding about this process: [How web browsers work - parsing the HTML (part 3, with illustrations)](https://dev.to/arikaturika/how-web-browsers-work-parsing-the-html-part-3-with-illustrations-45fi).\n\n![](assets/from-markup-to-pixels---a-look-inside-the-dom,-cssom,-and-render-tree_html-parser.webp)\n\n_Image Source: [How web browsers work - parsing the HTML (part 3, with illustrations)](https://dev.to/arikaturika/how-web-browsers-work-parsing-the-html-part-3-with-illustrations-45fi)_\n\n## How about CSS?\n\nAs soon as the browser begins to parse the HTML, once encountering a `link` tag to a CSS file, it simultaneously makes a request to fetch that. As you may anticipate, the procedure mirrors the way browsers form the DOM (from bytes to the object model). This process forms a tree structure called the **CSS Object Model** (CSSOM).\n\n\u003e For further information, please check out this article: [How web browsers work - parsing the CSS (part 4, with illustrations)](https://dev.to/arikaturika/how-web-browsers-work-parsing-the-css-part-4-with-illustrations-4c).\n\n![](assets/from-markup-to-pixels---a-look-inside-the-dom,-cssom,-and-render-tree_cssom.webp)\n\n_Image Source: [How web browsers work - parsing the CSS (part 4, with illustrations)](https://dev.to/arikaturika/how-web-browsers-work-parsing-the-css-part-4-with-illustrations-4c)_\n\nAs you can see in the example above, the elements have both inherited styles from the parent (depicted in white), and their own styles that overwrite the inherited ones (depicted in black). And since we can have several CSS files linked to our HTML, that's when the [Specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) comes in handy for the browser in determining which style to apply to a particular node.\n\n## Combining the DOM with the CSSOM\n\nThe browser traverses every visible node starting from the root of the DOM tree. Certain nodes are ignored by default (such as script or meta tags), while for others, the browser seeks the relevant rules within the CSSOM and proceeds to paint them on the screen. The browser will also ignores the nodes that are hidden due to their CSS property (`display: none` for example).\n\nNow the Render Tree holds the information of the **visibility** of each node and its **styles**, but what needs to be done next to calculate the exact position of those elements and paint them to the screen?\n\n![](assets/from-markup-to-pixels---a-look-inside-the-dom,-cssom,-and-render-tree_render-tree.webp)\n\n_Image Source: [How web browsers work - the render tree (part 7, with illustrations)](https://dev.to/arikaturika/how-web-browsers-work-the-render-tree-part-7-with-illustrations-24h3)_\n\n## The Layout/Reflow stage\n\nThe **Layout**/**Reflow** is a process to find the **geometry** of elements. The main thread walks through the DOM and constructs a layout tree that stores details such as **x and y coordinates**, as well as **bounding box dimensions**.\n\n![](assets/from-markup-to-pixels---a-look-inside-the-dom,-cssom,-and-render-tree_layout-tree.webp)\n\n_Image Source: [Inside look at modern web browser (part 3)](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/inside-browser-part3/)_\n\nThis process happens every time we change something in the DOM that affects the layout, which may include:\n\n- Adding or deleting elements from the DOM\n- Resizing the browser window\n- Changing the width, the position of an element or floating it\n\n## The Painting stage\n\nDespite having a DOM, style information, and a layout, these elements alone do not suffice for rendering a web page. Once the browser determines which nodes should be visible and calculates their positions within the viewport, the next step is to actually draw (render) them. Similar to the layout phase, the painting process doesn't occur just once but repeatedly whenever there are changes to the appearance of on-screen elements.\n\n**Painting** means the browser needs to draw every visual part of an element to the screen, including text, colors, borders, shadows, and elements like buttons and images. To ensure repainting can be done even faster than the initial paint, the drawing to the screen is generally broken down into several **layers**. When this happens, compositing becomes necessary.\n\n## Compositing\n\n**Compositing** is a method used to divide different elements of a webpage into distinct layers, independently rendering each layer, and then combining them to form a complete page in a separate thread known as the compositor thread. When scrolling occurs, this approach becomes efficient because the layers are already rendered, requiring only the composition of a new frame. Similarly, animation can be achieved by repositioning these layers and composing a new frame, enabling smooth and responsive animations.\n\nTo determine which elements should be placed within specific layers, the main thread goes through the layout tree to generate the **Layer tree**.\n\n\u003e Learn more about the **Layers panel** of DevTools [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/eliminate-content-repaints-with-the-new-layers-panel-in-chrome-e2c306d4d752/).\n\n![](assets/from-markup-to-pixels---a-look-inside-the-dom,-cssom,-and-render-tree_layer-tree.webp)\n\n_Image Source: [Inside look at modern web browser (part 3)](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/inside-browser-part3/)_\n\nOnce the Layer tree is established and the orders of rendering are determined, the main thread transfers that information to the compositor thread. The compositor thread then begins the process of rendering each layer. Some layers, such as those having the entire length of a webpage, can be quite extensive. To handle this, the compositor thread breaks them down into smaller sections known as **tiles** and dispatches each tile to **raster threads**. These raster threads are responsible for rendering each tile and storing the results in the memory of the GPU.\n\n![](assets/from-markup-to-pixels---a-look-inside-the-dom,-cssom,-and-render-tree_compositing.webp)\n\n_Image Source: [Inside look at modern web browser (part 3)](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/inside-browser-part3/)_\n\n## Reference\n\n- https://developer.chrome.com/blog/inside-browser-part3/\n- https://blog.logrocket.com/how-browser-rendering-works-behind-scenes/\n- https://dev.to/arikaturika/series/17842\n- https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1534201516063461376\n","title":"From Markup to Pixels - A look inside the DOM, CSSOM, and Render Tree","short_title":"","description":"A deep dive into the rendering process of a web page, exploring the Document Object Model (DOM), CSS Object Model (CSSOM), and the Render Tree.","tags":["rendering","dom","cssom","render-tree"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["namnd"],"date":"Mon Sep 11 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/from-markup-to-pixels-a-look-inside-the-dom-cssom-and-render-tree.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","from-markup-to-pixels-a-look-inside-the-dom-cssom-and-render-tree"]},{"content":"\nFrontend engineers use Hexadecimal color codes to represent colors, but they have some limitations:\n\n- Hexadecimal color codes are difficult to write and adjust, requiring the use of a third-party application to get right.\n- Hexadecimal color codes can be difficult to remember and use, especially for designers.\n\nHSL is the answer to resolving all of the painful points.\n\n## What is HSL?\n\n**HSL** stands for **hue**, **saturation**, and **lightness**.

In this case, the user data is in local side, and the web site is just the vehicle for delivering it.\n\nBeside that, IndexedDB has some important characteristics and much more powerful supplementations:\n\n- Stores almost any kind of key-value pairs, including **complex objects**\n- It is mostly **asynchronous**\n- Can store **significant volumes** of structured data, much bigger than localStorage\n- Supports **transactions** for reliability\n- Does not use Structured Query Language (SQL)\n\nLike most web storage solutions, IndexedDB follows a [same-origin policy](https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy) i.e. while you can access stored data within a domain, you cannot access data across different domains.\n\n## Important terminologies\n\n### Database\n\nDatabase in IndexedDB contains the object stores, which in turn contain the data you would like to persist. You can create multiple databases with the following must-have information:\n\n- Name: identifies the database and must stay constant\n- Current version: with default value of 1\n\n```javascript\nconst openRequest = indexedDB.open('shelf' /* name */, 1 /* version */)\n...\nopenRequest.onsuccess = () =\u003e {\n\tconst db = openRequest.result\n\t...\n}\n```\n\n\u003e [Read more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBDatabase) about methods, attributes and how to use **IDBDatabase**.\n\n### Object store\n\nObject store is an individual bucket to store data. It is the **core concept** of IndexedDB. You can think of object stores as being similar to tables in traditional relational databases. A database may have multiple stores and each of them must have a name that is **unique** within its database.\n\n![](assets/cYgLD5U.png)\n\n```javascript\ndb.createObjectStore('books' /* name */, { keyPath: 'id' })\n```\n\n\u003e [Read more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBObjectStore) about **IDBObjectStore**, an interface of IndexDB API that represents object stores.\n\n### Transaction\n\nAn atomic set of _data-access_ and _data-modification_ operations on a particular database, they should either **all succeed** or **all fail**. It is how you interact with the data in a database. **Any reading or changing of data in the database must happen in a transaction**.\n\nA database connection can have several active transactions associated with it at a time, so long as the writing transactions do not have overlapping scopes. The scope of transactions gives us information of during the transaction, which object stores are involved (and are expected to be modified) and which of them remain.\n\n```javascript\nconst trans = db.transaction(\"books\" /* store */, \"readwrite\" /* type */)\n\n// start operating on this store\nconst objStore = trans.objectStore(\"books\")\n\nconst book = {\n\tid: 'Remote - Office not required',\n\tprice: 10,\n}\n\nconst request = objStore.add(book /* value */) // operations must happen in a transaction\n\nrequest.onsuccess = () =\u003e {\n\t...\n}\n```\n\n\u003e [Read more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBTransaction) about **IDBTransaction**, an interface of the IndexedDB API that provides a static, asynchronous transaction on a database.\n\n### Index\n\nAn **index** is a specialized object store for looking up records in another object store (often called the *referenced object store*). The **index** is a key-value storage where all its values are the keys of the referenced object store. Hence all its records are automatically populated when a new record is inserted, updated or deleted.\n\n\u003e [Read more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBIndex) about **IDBIndex** interface of the IndexedDB API.\n\n**Searching by a field using an index**:\n\n```javascript\n...\nopenRequest.onupgradeneeded = () =\u003e {\n\tconst books = db.createObjectStore('books', {keyPath: 'id'})\n\tconst index = books.createIndex('price_idx', 'price')\n}\n```\n\nSearch the `books` object store by `price` key: ![](assets/TjHErHh.png)\n\n### Cursor\n\nWith a huge object store, bigger than the available memory, `getAll` might fail to get all records as an array. Cursors provide the means to work around that.\n\n**A cursor is a special object that traverses the object storage using a given query, and returns one key/value at a time, thus saving memory**.\n\n```javascript\nconst request = store.openCursor('id' /* query */, ['next' /* or 'prev', 'nextunique'... */])\n\n// to get keys only, you can use 'openKeyCursor' instead of 'openCursor'\n```\n\n\u003e [Read more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBCursor) about **IDBCursor**, an interface of IndexedDB API that represents a cursor.\n\n## Limitation\n\nIndexedDB is designed to cover most cases that need client-side storage. However, it is not designed for a few cases like the following:\n\n- Not all languages sort strings in the same way, so internationalized sorting is not supported\n- The API is not designed for synchronizing with a server-side database\n- It does not have an equivalent of the `LIKE` operator in SQL for full text searching\n\nMoreover, errors that are **out of developers' control** can happen for a variety of reasons. For example, some browsers like **Firefox** or **Edge** currently don't allow writing to IndexedDB when in private browsing mode. There's also the possibility that a user is on a device that's almost out of disk space, and the browser might not allow storing anything else at all.\n\nUsing IndexedDB is also likely to require **a lot more coding** than localStorage or cookies. But if the values you’re storing are complex JavaScript objects that would be difficult to serialize, or if you need a transactional model, then it may be worthwhile.\n\n\u003e Detailed information about Limitations of IndexedDB from MDN site [[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Basic_Terminology#limitations)]\n\n## Reference\n\n- https://javascript.info/indexeddb\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB\n- https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-indexeddb/\n- https://web.dev/indexeddb/\n","title":"Intro to IndexedDB","short_title":"","description":"IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage like localStorage and cookies.

One's code will be hard to organize and maintain if they don't use modules and no one wants all the codes mingling with each others.\n- Modules also allow developers share code to the world through a package manager like NPM.\n\n## History of JavaScript's modules\n\nIn order to understand about the development of JavaScipt's modules, we need to walk through 4 stages: Vanilla, IIFEs, CommonJS and ESM.\n\n### Vanilla (1990s - early 2000s)\n\nWhen JavaScript was first invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, it was known to have been created in 10 days and the creator himself doesn't think that his programing language would be as popular as today.\n\n\u003e “No one thought JavaScript would be used at the wide scale it is. Not just reaching lots of people on the Web, but large application like Gmail… To write large code, you don’t just want this little snippet language that I made for beginners…“ Bredan Eich (Creator of JavaScript)\n\nSo modules aren't a thing back then, developers would mostly used inline-scripting and script-tags and no one would think of scalability, maintaining a large code base would be a nightmare because there is no structures and organizations.\n\n#### YAHOO manifesto\n\nAround 2006, a global manifesto was raised by a team of UI developers from YAHOO which was **\"Global Variable are dangerous\"**. The point they trying to make is that using global variable is a risky practice and all the people back then are engaging in. Global variables can spark conflict between naming if there are many people involving in developing the same program and since everyone can access it, it is not very secure.\n\n#### YAHOO Solution?\n\nCreate a huge Global namespace object and parse all the variables in that object.\n\n\u003e **Example**: YAHOO.value.getValue\n\n### IIFEs (early to late 2000s)\n\nIFFEs or Immediately invoked function expression was used with closures to keep the private data hidden, basically the ideal is that you only need to care of what the function returns and not what happen inside it.\n\n#### Example\n\n```js\nvar Dialogue = function () {\n  //private variables\n  var dialogue\n  //exposed functions\n  return {\n    hello: function () {\n      dialog = 'Hello Dwarves!'\n      console.log(dialogue)\n    },\n    goodbye: function () {\n      dialog = 'Goodbye Dwarves!'\n      console.log(dialogue)\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAt this stage we have solve the Global namespace pollution problem but we haven't got to the point that we can swapping modules with one another and copy/paste function happens all the time.\n\n### CommonJS (early to mid 2010)\n\nAround 2009, people are hype about the potential of JavaScript, you can now run JavaScript on the server-side. And come with that a proposal was made for JavaScript to have a standard way to include other modules. Node created a module implementations name CommonJS.\n\n#### Implementation of CommonJS:\n\n- **Import**: using `require()` method.\n- **Export**: **module** object using `module.exports`.\n\nThis was design for server development.\n\n#### Synchronus modules loading\n\n- **MODULE.\\_LOAD**: Node caches it's modules (Node check for cache files, if it not there it will create an instance and caches it).\n- **MODULE.\\_COMPILE**: Create a `require` function that speciffic for each modules and generate a wrapper function to scope variables the run the wrapper function.\n\n#### Node module wrapper function\n\n```js\n;(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {\n  // Module code actually lives in here\n})\n```\n\n#### Example\n\n```js\n//dialogue.js\nvar getDialog (function (){\n    console.log(\"Hello Dwarves!\");\n})\nmodule.exports = getDialogue;\n```\n\n```js\n//main.js\nconst sayHello = require('./dialogue.js')\n```\n\nAt this time, CommonJs is a real noviation, organizing files and maintaining code has become much easier.\n\n### ESM (2010s - present)\n\nESM or ES modules was supported by all major browsers and was the first **built-in module** in JavaScript and introduce top-level `await` functionality for module imports.\n\n#### Top-level await\n\nA feature accessible within modules is top level await. This implies that the await keyword is functional. It enables modules to function as sizable asynchronous functions, allowing code to be assessed before usage in parent modules without preventing the loading of siblings.\n\n#### ESM Asynchronus ?\n\nThe loading and parsing for ESM modules is indeed asynchronous, but the execution of the code in them is synchronous and serialized based on the order they are imported.\n\n#### Implementation ESM:\n\n- **Import**: using `import` method.\n- **Export**: using `export` method.\n\n#### Example\n\n```js\n//Export syntax\n\n//dialog.js\nexport default const dialog = \"Hello Dwarves!\";\n\n//utils.js\nexport const getHours = () =\u003e //do something;\nexport const getMinutes = () =\u003e //do something;\n```\n\n```js\n//Import syntax\n\nimport dialog from './dialog.js'\n\nimport * as utility from './utils.js'\nimport { getHours, getMinutes } from './utils.js'\n```\n\n#### ESM in the browsers\n\nESM has a specfic module type in the browser which they are processed differently and create a fallback for older browsers using bundle.\n\n```html\n\u003c!-- Adding module script --\u003e\n\u003cscript type=\"module\" src=\"main.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c!-- Fallback for older browsers --\u003e\n\u003cscript nomodule src=\"bundle.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\n### CommonJS vs ESM\n\n- Right now ESM was supported on all browsers and the latest version of Node except version below version 12.\n- ESM waits to execute any code in a module until all of it's imports have been loaded and parsed, then does the binding/side-effects stuff in the relative order that they happen.\n- ESM imports are asynchronous (which also allows for top-level `await`).\n- CJS executes imports as it finds them, blocking until they finish.\n- CJS works in Node but does **not** work in browsers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlthough CommonJS can still be used for server development since synchronous wasn't an issue and it was built by Node, using ESM is still the better way to keep the syntax consistent if you were to develop client-side and server-side with JavaScript.\n\n#### Reference\n\n-

For data intensive SPAs with CPU-intensive tasks, the single-threaded nature of Javascript starts to hinder the application's perceived performance when you cannot fit those CPU-intensive tasks into a 16.67 ms/frame window (translates to 60fps). That doesn't even account for code execution time of frameworks (React, Vue...etc), which then leaves you with approximately only a 10 ms/frame window or less to complete all your tasks on the main thread to make user interaction feel smooth and snappy.\n\nFortunately for us, JavaScript provides a couple of tools to solve these problems with some new features: Threading (through Web Worker) and Coroutines (through generators).\n\n## Threading with Web Worker\n\nIf you don't know what a Web Worker is, check out [parallelism-in-javascript]() for a quick introduction.\n\nWith Web Worker we can offload a bunch of processing to another thread and it will not impact the performance of the main thread. Sounds perfect, but it comes with a cost: `serialization`.\n\nBecause of the heavy sandboxing of JS environment, using web workers only works well if we have small to medium inputs and outputs. Because all of the data transported between the main thread and worker thread is going to be serialized, which blocks the main thread while that happens (unless you are using binary formats like Shared Array Buffer or Typed Arrays, which comes with other caveats that is outside of the scope of this note).\n\nIf `serialization` is not a problem for your app then Web Worker will probably do a great job to enhance your app's performance and UX.\n\nFor real time apps that require continuously recalculation of data when new data comes, you can implement a game-loop-like updater function inside the web worker code to periodically emit data to main thread once per an interval time limit. That pattern works well because it allows you to control how often main thread should receive new data and UI should rerender.\n\n## Coroutines with generators\n\nWhen you have a serialization problem with Web Worker, another tool you can reach for is coroutines.\n\nYou are most likely already aware of coroutines in one form or another. A coroutine is basically a thread of programming logic that is working its way to completion at the same time as other things are doing the same. Or to put it simply: a coroutine is an execution that can be suspended and resumed.\n\nGenerators was introduced in ES6, adding the capability of suspending and resuming code execution. Here's a number generator that generates from 1 to 99:\n\n```javascript\nfunction* numberGen(maxValue = 100) {\n  let currentValue = 0\n  while (currentValue \u003c maxValue) {\n    currentValue++\n    yield currentValue\n  }\n}\n\n// Generate and get numbers\nconst sequence = numberGen()\nconsole.log(sequence.next()) // Prints : { value: 1, done: false }\nconsole.log(sequence.next()) // Prints : { value: 2, done: false }\n// When it reaches the 99th call\nconsole.log(sequence.next()) // Prints : { value: 99, done: true }\n```\n\nSo, ES6 generator allows us to run code and yield values whenever we like but it's still a rough tool, for our problem we need to combine generator with browser's `requestIdleCallback()` to request main thread to do an amount of work when it's idle, then see if there is enough time left to do more work, if not yield control back to main thread then queue another run the next time main thread is idle. Luckily somebody smart already thought of that, you can checkout [js-coroutines](https/github.com/miketalbot/js-coroutines) for a complete implementation and evaluate if it solves your app's problem.\n\n## References\n\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator\n- https://javascript.info/generators\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback\n","title":"Mitigate blocking the main thread","short_title":"","description":"We all know that for web applications, perceived performance is highly importance for our users.

The idea is now that we're back to the web era of 10 years ago of truly \"static\" websites. Each link navigation triggers a full-page reload to the new HTML page with no SPA-style navigation (a navigation style that doesn't trigger a full page reload, but replace the current page with the new page, similar to an app-like experience).\n\n### Why?\n\nThe web community has spent huge efforts to make SPA faster and more SEO friendly than how it was originally introduced: SSR and streaming mechanisms allow for making meaningful content visible as fast as possible. But we've come to a realization: nothing beats an MPA in terms of speed of page loading and SEO.\n\nSSR did a wonderful job bringing faster page loads to SPA, but the problem still exists: we've been sending really huge, mostly unused, JavaScript payloads to users.\n\n## Why not SPA?\n\nWith the current advanced web technologies, mainly web libraries/frameworks like React, Preact, Vue, Svelte, etc - most companies opt to build their web products completely with those libraries. Since these frameworks are excellent in building SPAs, we've been seeing a lot more SaaS products as SPA now more than ever.\n\nSPA isn't technically a bad thing, it makes navigation feels more \"native\" and smooth - with features like preloading and background fetching for new pages that the user might likely visit. In fact, it's so great that a lot of recognizable web software are built as an SPA: Facebook, Twitter, Notion, etc...\n\nHowever, SPA does come with a cost that is not so obvious at first glance: **a large initial bundle size**.\n\n### The SPA story\n\nThe way most SPAs works is that (almost) everything in our web UI is composed with JavaScript (with or without frameworks). JavaScript is run this way to create HTML at run-time, with the most basic form of this pattern being `document.createElement(\"div\")`. Now, imagine if every text, button, section, popup, and relevant UI components of our website were built using this pattern. Why is it not-so-good to use SPA?\n\nThe answer: [It's the cost of JavaScript](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-04-21-the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks/). Unlike raw HTML, using JavaScript to create HTML implies unseen overhead. This amounts to the cost of downloading, parsing, and executing JavaScript. Even before we can see anything on the screen, the browser has to run all of this to completion in order to show us something meaningful. Depending on the context, this effect can cause long delays between when a user visits a site and when a meaningful content is visible to that user. Nowadays, web performance tools measures and categorizes this delay as one of the most [important metric for frontends: (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/).\n\n### SSR \u0026 hydration\n\nThen we have SSR \"Server Side Rendering\" - used to improve LCP and provide better SEO capability for SPAs. In React, this feature is handled with `ReactDOMServer.renderToString`. The idea is simple: render the whole React tree to raw HTML on server and return it to browser. The user will then be able to see content immediately after HTML is downloaded.\n\nNow we have the best of both worlds, with SPA \u0026 SSR - an app-like experience with fast content delivery time!\n\nNot so fast. We’re still missing one final piece - the raw HTML returned by our server won't be fully interactive (e.g: the \"counter\" state won't change when we click buttons). In order to make our page interactive, we have to \"hydrate\" it.\n\n**Hydration** is the process of turning the raw HTML we returned earlier to a fully interactive React tree of components. For React, this can be done using the `ReactDOM.hydrate` method. So full process would be:\n\n1. `renderToString` \u0026 send the (html) string to clients on the server\n2. Loads the corresponding React component and hydrate it on the client:\n   - `import Page from \"pages/home\"`\n   - `hydrate(Page, document.getElementById(\"app\"))`\n\n\"Sooo that’s still all good!\". Yes, except for one thing: do we really need ALL our components to be interactive? Probably not, especially for cases when we're building a basic landing/marketing site using React, where most of our content is static except for subscribe forms, sliders, etc. Hydrating the whole page in this scenario is called _hydration waste_: only some components are actual interactive components, yet we hydrate everything from the top down, which in turn makes our [time-to-interactive (TTI)](https://web.dev/interactive/) longer.\n\n## Partial hydration\n\nThis concept proposes hydrating only parts of the entire site - parts where we need interactivity, this in turn help us to ship less JavaScript to the client by only hydrating demanding components. Thus, we improving page load time \u0026 time-to-interactive. As of now, only some static site frameworks support this out of the box: [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/component-hydration) \u0026 [Marko](https://markojs.com/).\n\nTo implement this from scratch in a React project, although doable, requires [quite a lot of implementation](https://medium.com/@luke_schmuke/how-we-achieved-the-best-web-performance-with-partial-hydration-20fab9c808d5), and it may be hard to debug issues in the process.\n\n## MPA, SPA or Partial Hydration?\n\nSame old answer: it depends. If you’re building an analytics dashboard, sports betting portal, or just a better version of PowerPoint, stick with SPA (and SSR, if needed). These types of websites have lots of interactive UI to make Partial Hydration just not worth it.\n\nOtherwise, if it's your landing site, similar to [netlify.com](http://netlify.com/) or [dwarves.foundation](https://dwarves.foundation/), which essentially just has only 1-2 pieces of UI that require JavaScript to run, and you’re building it with React: try to apply Partial Hydration where possible. While `react-static` or `gatsby` does not (yet) support partial hydration, you can try out [astro.build](https://astro.build/). Here, partial hydration is a first class citizen, and it comes with a decent static site generator with good React support.\n\nFor MPA, if you prefer to keep building your site with React, you can still make it with an MPA. Just do SSR on the server and AVOID hydrating the whole page on the client. Obviously interactive components won't be interactive, but at least it's a good start.\n","title":"MPA, SPA and Partial Hydration","short_title":"","description":"MPA, SPA and Partial Hydration are three different approaches to building web applications.","tags":["frontend","engineering/frontend"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["huygn"],"date":"Thu Mar 24 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/mpa-spa-and-partial-hydration.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","mpa-spa-and-partial-hydration"]},{"content":"\nMost of applications nowadays are created with the aim to be on the web. JavaScript has become a mainstream programming language to support the direction. However, being designed as a single-threaded language doesn't give JavaScript the power to support heavyweight applications as when we talk about image/video processing, online games or even data mining. This naturally creates a demand to support Parallelism in the language.\n\n### Web Worker\n\nWeb Worker is one of the initial attempts that successfully brings the concept of parallelism to browsers. A web worker creates a JavaScript thread performing tasks, without interfering with the user interface.\n\nWeb workers run in a different context from the main thread. Because of that, `document` and `window` objects of the main thread are not accessible in web workers. However, it is possible to use XMLHttpRequest, WebSocket or data storage mechanism.\n\nThere are two kinds of workers: shared and dedicated. A dedicated worker can be only accessed from the script that initiated it while the state of shared workers can be accessed from multiple scripts.\n\nCommunication between the worker thread and the main thread is via a system of messages where both sides send data using the `postMessage()` method, and respond to messages via the `onmessage` even handle. The data is serializable. It means data is copied rather than shared. So, there is a performance bottleneck if the amount of transferred data is huge.\n\n```javascript\n# main.js\nconst myWorker = new Worker('./worker.js');\n\nmyWorker.postMessage(1);\n\nmyWorker.onmessage = function(event){\n\tconsole.log(`Receieved ${event.data} from web worker`)\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n# worker.js\nonmessage = function(event){\n\tconsole.log(`${event.data} received from main script`);\n\n\tif(event.data === 1){\n\t\tpostMessage(2);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### WebCL and other OpenCL based frameworks\n\nAnother approach to apply the concurrency model for web applications is [WebCL](https://www.khronos.org/webcl). It is a JavaScript binding to the OpenCL standard that enables web applications to harness GPU and multi-core CPU parallel processing from within a web browser, thus, enabling the possibility to deploy computationally intensive applications. Currently, no browsers natively support WebCL but non-native add-on can be used to embed WebCL in web browsers.\n\n[RiverTrail](https://github.com/IntelLabs/RiverTrail/) is another framework that relies on OpenCL to provide support for data parallel programming in JavaScript. It works by extending JavaScript with new data-parallel constructs that are translated at runtime into a low-level hardware abstract layer.\n\nHowever, most of OpenCL based frameworks developed during the period are no longer being in active development as no browser vendors have a concrete plan to implement it in their environment at the moment. It seems the attention to boost the performance of the web is bet on different approaches such as [WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly) or [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/). So, at the time of writing, Web Worker is the only approach to bring parallelism in web applications in production.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://www.khronos.org/registry/webcl/specs/latest/1.0/#3.1\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebCL\n- https://intellabs.github.io/RiverTrail/\n","title":"Parallelism in JavaScript","short_title":"","description":"Parallelism in JavaScript is a technique to improve the performance of web applications by executing multiple tasks simultaneously.","tags":["javascript","concurrency","frontend","parallelism"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh"],"date":"Mon Apr 04 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/parallelism-in-javascript.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","parallelism-in-javascript"]},{"content":"\nThe _**\"parse, don't validate\"**_ approach is all about processing incoming data and failing in a controlled manner if parsing fails. It is all about leveraging trustworthy, secure, and typed data structures within your code and ensuring that all incoming data is handled at the very edges of your systems. Instead of passing receiving data deep into your code, parse it immediately and fail quickly if necessary.\n\nParsing is better than validation because it requires you to explicitly handle every incoming data. It provides a type-safe method of working and makes it difficult to spread harmful material throughout your apps and data storage. However, it is true that parsing frequently incorporates data validation.\n\n## Overview\n\n### What is parsing?\n\n- **Parsing** is the process of analyzing a string or symbol either in natural language, computer languages or data structures, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar.\n- The **\"_process of analyzing_\"** and **\"_conforming to the rules of a_ [_thingy_]\"** are crucial here. _Thingy_ is our schema and type, which in this instance may be thought of as forming our _formal grammar_ (don't worry if you don't know what it means). _Process of analyzing_ is the work our code does when trying to fit data to the schema \u0026 type. The reason why we are saying “schema \u0026 type” is that we want them somehow to be the same thing, instead of two separate things that may or may not be in sync.\n\n### Examples in Typescript with yup\n\n#### Example\n\n```ts\nimport * as yup from 'yup'\n\nlet schema = yup.object().shape({\n  name: yup.string().required(),\n  age: yup.number().required().positive().integer(),\n  email: yup.string().email(),\n})\n// data from an API, from user, etc. Note that the type would be `any`\n// (or perhaps `unkown`) as we don't really know what it looks like\n// if it comes from outside\nconst data: any = {\n  name: 'jimmy',\n  age: 24,\n}\n// check validity\nschema.isValid(data).then(function (valid) {\n  console.log('isValid?', valid) // =\u003e true\n  // do something with the data, however, it's still `any`/`unkown`....\n})\n```\n\nWe still don't have a _type_ for our 'data,' as you can see. It remains 'any/unknown'. Sure, we can typecast it, but it introduces a problem: we now have to maintain a'schema' and a 'type' separately, by hand, with nothing ensuring they match.\n\n#### Example with Typecast\n\n```ts\nlet userSchema = yup.object().shape({\n  name: yup.string().required(),\n  age: yup.number().required().positive().integer(),\n  email: yup.string().email(),\n})\n\ntype UserType = {\n  name: string\n  age: number\n  email: string\n}\n// check validity\nschema.isValid(data).then(function (valid) {\n  const user = data as UserType // it's valid so let's cast!\n})\n```\n\nStill, how can you ensure that 'userSchema' and 'UserType' are in sync? Do they even stand for the same thing?\n\n#### Example with parsing function\n\n```ts\n// Let's use some custom type aliases for readability\ntype PositiveInteger = number\ntype Email = string\ntype URL = string\n// Type guards to validate invidiual values, fields\nconst isPositiveInteger = (x: any): x is PositiveInteger =\u003e yup.number().required().positive().integer().isType(x)\nconst isEmail = (x: any): x is Email =\u003e yup.string().required().email().isType(x)\nconst isString = (x: any): x is string =\u003e yup.string().required().isType(x)\n// UserType again, now with our custom type aliases\ntype UserType = {\n  name: string\n  age: PositiveInteger\n  email?: Email\n}\n/**\nparse, don't validate\ncompiler can help us quite a bit here to make sure the parsing\nis actually correct\n*/\nconst parseToUserType = (x: any): UserType | Error =\u003e {\n  let { name, age, email, website, createdOn } = x\n  if (!isString(name)) return new Error('invalid name')\n  if (!isPositiveInteger(age)) return new Error('invalid age')\n  email = isEmail(email) ? email : undefined // optional, silently drop invalid values\n  return { age, name, createdOn, email, website }\n}\n// Business logic is pretty awesome now!\nfunction myHandler(): Response {\n  const userType: UserType | Error = parseToUserType(data)\n\n  if (userType instanceof Error) return { error: 'Ohh there was a 400 error' }\n  // use UserType normally, do what ever you want\n  return { message: `Welcome, ${userType.name}` }\n}\n```\n\n- Business logic can now parse any data to `UserType`. \\_Just remember to check whether there’s an Error or not.\n- We are using more precise types than `string` or `number`\\_ due to how type aliases work.\n- The error-prone, dangerous, not-that-well-type-checked code is limited to type guards.\n- TS compiler makes sure our parser actually works. _We can safely write our_`_(x: any) =\u003e UserType | Error` parser function with good support from the type checker.\n\n### Reference\n\nhttps://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing https://itnext.io/parse-dont-validate-incoming-data-in-typescript-d6d5bfb092c8\n","title":"Parse, don't validate in TypeScript","short_title":"","description":"The \"parse, don't validate\" approach is about processing incoming data and failing in a controlled manner if parsing fails.","tags":["frontend","validation","typescript"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["namtrhg"],"date":"Thu Jan 05 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/parse-dont-validate-in-typescript.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","parse-dont-validate-in-typescript"]},{"content":"\n## Why should you read this article?\n\n- Understand how state in React works\n\n```jsx\nconst [isPlayerA, setIsPlayerA] = useState(true)\n\nfunction Counter(name) {\n  const [score, setScore] = useState(0)\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        {name}: {score}\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setScore(score + 1)}\u003e+1\u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  )\n}\n\n// ----------\n\n// Do you think they are the same?\n// ----- Approach 1\n{\n  isPlayerA ? \u003cCounter name=\"A\" /\u003e : \u003cCounter name=\"B\" /\u003e\n}\n\n// ----- Approach 2\n{\n  isPlayerA \u0026\u0026 \u003cCounter name=\"A\" /\u003e\n}\n{\n  !isPlayerA \u0026\u0026 \u003cCounter name=\"B\" /\u003e\n}\n```\n\n## The UI Tree\n\n![](assets/preserving-and-resetting-state-in-react_ui_tree.webp)\n\nAs you can see in the below picture, the rendering flow of React should be:\n\nJSX --_(React)_--\u003e UI trees --_(React DOM)_--\u003e DOM\n\n## State is tied to a position in the tree\n\n- Actually, the component has _no state_. The state is stored in React and associated with the correct component based on its **position** in the UI tree.\n- React preserves a component’s state for as long as it’s being rendered at its position in the UI tree.\n- For example:\n\n```js\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [score, setScore] = useState(0)\n\n  return \u003cdiv\u003e...\u003c/div\u003e\n}\n\nreturn (\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cCounter /\u003e\n    \u003cCounter /\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n)\n```\n\n- Q: Is the two `\u003cCounter /\u003e` components the same?\n- A: **No!** **These are two separate counters because each is rendered at its own position in the tree** =\u003e each of them will get its own, independent `score` state.\n- In case the `\u003cCounter /\u003e` get removed -\u003e React discards its state\n\n## Preserves state\n\n- Take a look on the below example\n\n```js\nconst [isFancy, setIsFancy] = useState(false);\n\n return (\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    {isFancy ? (\n      \u003cCounter isFancy={true} /\u003e\n    ) : (\n      \u003cCounter isFancy={false} /\u003e\n    )}\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n  ...\n)\n```\n\n- Q: Are `\u003cCounter isFancy={true} /\u003e` and `\u003cCounter isFancy={false} /\u003e` the same component?\n- A: **Yes!** Because: same component + same position + with React's perspective -\u003e it's the same Counter.\n- Q: Why do I say it is the same position?\n- A: Take a look at the UI Tree section, that it's the **position of the UI tree**, not in the JSX markup\n\n=\u003e **Same component + Same position -\u003e Preserve state**\n\n## Different components at the same position reset state\n\n```js\nconst [isPaused, setIsPaused] = useState(false);\n\n return (\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    {isPaused ? (\n      \u003cp\u003eSee ya!\u003c/p\u003e\n    ) : (\n      \u003cCounter /\u003e\n    )}\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n  ...\n)\n```\n\n- In this example, we switch between _different_ component types at the same position. Initially, the first child of `\u003cdiv\u003e` contained a `Counter`. But when swapped in a `p`, React removed the `Counter` from the UI tree and destroyed its state\n\n![](assets/preserving-and-resetting-state-in-react_diff-comp-same-position.webp)\n\n=\u003e **Different component + Same position -\u003e Reset the state of its entire subtree**\n\n## Resetting state at the same position\n\nBy default, React preserves state of a component while it stays at the same position. But we have ability to reset the state.\n\nBack to the example at the beginning of the article\n\n```js\n// Approach 1\n{\n  isPlayerA ? \u003cCounter name=\"A\" /\u003e : \u003cCounter name=\"B\" /\u003e\n}\n```\n\n- Q: If we use approach 1, what happens?\n- A: Because the counter component in two case is the same component + same position =\u003e The state still the same. That makes a bug, although the name props changed, but the `score` still stay. It's normal in React, but it isn't what we want, right? We have 2 options for it\n\n### Option 1: Rendering component with different positions\n\n- It's exactly what Approach 2 does, rendering component with different positions\n\n```js\n{\n  isPlayerA \u0026\u0026 \u003cCounter name=\"A\" /\u003e\n}\n{\n  !isPlayerA \u0026\u0026 \u003cCounter name=\"B\" /\u003e\n}\n```\n\n![](assets/preserving-and-resetting-state-in-react_opt1-diff-position.webp)\n\n### Option 2: Resetting state with a key (recommendation)\n\n```js\n{\n  isPlayerA ? \u003cCounter name=\"A\" key=\"A\" /\u003e : \u003cCounter name=\"B\" key=\"B\" /\u003e\n}\n```\n\n- Keys aren’t just for lists! You can use keys to make React distinguish between any components. By default, React uses order within the parent (first Counter component, second Counter component,...). By using key, React will know A's counter, B's counter =\u003e React won't share state between them.\n\n## Reference\n\n- https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state\n","title":"Preserving and Resetting state in React","short_title":"","description":"State in React is tied to a position in the UI tree.","tags":["fronten","react","hooks","state-management"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["toanbku"],"date":"Mon Feb 27 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/preserving-and-resetting-state-in-react.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","preserving-and-resetting-state-in-react"]},{"content":"\n## What is Layout Thrashing\n\n![](assets/prevent-layout-thrashing_layout-thrashing.webp)\n\nLayout thrashing means forcing the browser to calculate a layout that is never rendered to the screen, which hurts performance.\n\n## Why\n\nLayout Thrashing happens, when you request layout information of an element or the document, while the layout is in an **invalidated state**.\n\n```js\n// any DOM or CSSOM change flags the layout as invalid\ndocument.body.classList.add('foo')\n\n// reads layout == forces layout calculation\nconst box = element.getBoundingClientRect()\n\n// write/mutate\ndocument.body.appendChild(someBox)\n\n//read/measure\nconst color = getComputedStyle(someOtherBox).color\n```\n\nMixing Layout Read \u0026 Layout Mutation must wait for the browser to recalculate the layout and reflow to return your Layout value.\n\n![](assets/prevent-layout-thrashing_dont-touch-me.webp)\n\n## How to fix\n\nWe can resolve the problem by isolating your reads from your writes. The steps would be:\n\n- Batch Read Layout first\n- Then Mutate Layout later\n\n```js\n// reads layout\nconst box = element.getBoundingClientRect()\nconst color = getComputedStyle(someOtherBox).color\n\n// write\ndocument.body.classList.add('foo')\ndocument.body.appendChild(someBox)\n```\n\nOr use a library such as [fastdom](https://github.com/wilsonpage/fastdom) which abstracts those steps:\n\n```js\nimport fastdom from 'fastdom'\n\nfunction resizeAllParagraphsToMatchBoxWidth(paragraphs, box) {\n  fastdom.measure(() =\u003e {\n    const width = box.offsetWidth\n\n    fastdom.mutate(() =\u003e {\n      for (let i = 0; i \u003c paragraphs.length; i++) {\n        paragraphs[i].style.width = width + 'px'\n      }\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\n## How to debug\n\nOpen `Performance Tab` on Dev tool, slow down your CPU, and click `Start Profiling`.\n\n![](assets/prevent-layout-thrashing_layout-thrashing-debug.webp)\n\nFind purple tasks and get info in detail:\n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://afarkas.github.io/layout-thrashing/material/layout-thrashing-debug.mp4\" controls\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## List of commands causing Layout Thrashing we need to be careful when using it\n\nGenerally, all APIs that synchronously provide layout metrics will trigger forced reflow/layout.

We listen to the `scroll` event \u0026 modify the DOM with the handler, triggering needless reflows and paints.\n\nFor more simple use cases, with pure CSS, we can:\n\n- Avoid messing with the browser's rendering pipeline\n- Allow browsers to leverage hardware acceleration while rendering, ensuring consistent frame rates \u0026 a smooth scrolling experience\n- Combine with other CSS features (e.g. responsive)\n\n## How it works\n\nFirst, let's establish some barebones markup:\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv class=\"parallax\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"layer layer-1\"\u003e...\u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"layer layer-2\"\u003e...\u003c/div\u003e\n  ...\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nAnd the basic styles:\n\n```css\n.parallax {\n  perspective: 1px;\n  height: 100vh;\n  overflow-x: hidden;\n  overflow-y: auto;\n}\n\n.layer {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  bottom: 0;\n  left: 0;\n}\n\n.layer-1 {\n  transform: translateZ(0);\n}\n\n.layer-2 {\n  transform: translateZ(-1px);\n}\n```\n\nThe `parallax` class is where the parallax magic happens:\n\n- Defining the `height` and `perspective` style properties of an element will lock the perspective to its centre, creating a fixed origin 3D viewport.\n- Setting `overflow-y: auto` will allow the content inside the element to scroll in the usual way, but now descendant elements will be rendered relative to the fixed perspective. This is the key to creating the parallax effect.\n\nThe `layer` class defines a layer of content to which the parallax effect will be applied. The `absolute` position is optional, for the sake of display. You'll see what I meant in a moment.\n\nFinally, the `layer-{{n}}` class is used to set Z offset of the layers. If we consider the `parallax` container is a camera viewport, the Z offset will determine whether a layer is farther away, or closer to the viewport. **The farther away a layer is, the slower it'll appear to be scrolling.**\n\nCheck it out in the CodePen below:\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"400\" style=\"width:100%\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Pure CSS Parallax (1) - Barebones\" src=\"https://codepen.io/ngolapnguyen/embed/wvjGRRp?default-tab=result\" frameborder=\"no\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Common practices\n\n### Parallax with multiple sections\n\nMost parallax sites break the page into distinct sections where different effects can be applied. Here's how to do that.\n\nFirst, we need a `group` element to group our layers together:\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv class=\"parallax\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"group\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"layer layer-1\"\u003eLayer 1.1\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"layer layer-2\"\u003eLayer 1.2\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"layer layer-3\"\u003eLayer 1.3\u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n  ...\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nAnd now the styles:\n\n```css\n.group {\n  ...\n  transform-style: preserve-3d;\n}\n```\n\nThe property `transform-style: preserve-3d` prevents the browser from flattening the `layer` elements, indicating that children of the element should be positioned in the 3D-space. More on the property [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-style).\n\nOne important rule to keep in mind when grouping elements is, **we cannot clip the content of a group**. Setting `overflow: hidden` on a `group` will break the parallax effect. Unclipped content will result in descendant elements overflowing, so we need to be creative with the `z-index` values of the groups to ensure content is correctly revealed/hidden as the visitor scrolls through the document.\n\n### Depth correction\n\nTrue to 3D transforms, elements that are farther away from the viewport will appear smaller than those that are closer. If we want them to appear to be rendered as their original size (e.g. same font-size and all), we can use the `scale` transform to do that:\n\n```css\n.layer-2 {\n  transform: translateZ(-1px) scale(2);\n}\n```\n\nThe scale factor can be calculated with the following formula:\n\n```\nscale = 1 + (translateZ * -1) / perspective\n```\n\n### Debugging\n\nWhen you are working with parallax, it can be easier to get lost among the different layers. Taking a different perspective will allow you to know where everything is in the 3D space - which you can do by applying simple transform to the group elements:\n\n```css\n.group {\n  transform: translate3d(700px, 0, -800px) rotateY(30deg);\n}\n```\n\nYou can try out all the common practices I have mentioned in the CodePen below:\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"400\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Pure CSS Parallax (2) - Common Practices\" src=\"https://codepen.io/ngolapnguyen/embed/XWqdOJr?default-tab=result\" frameborder=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## References\n\n- https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-style\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfeqDyMUx4\n","title":"Pure CSS Parallax","short_title":"","description":"This article demonstrates how to use CSS transforms, perspective and some scaling trickery to create a pure CSS parallax scrolling website.","tags":["frontend","html","css","animation"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["mashiro5951"],"date":"Sat Sep 10 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/pure-css-parallax.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","pure-css-parallax"]},{"content":"\nCode splitting is a technique used to optimize JavaScript bundles by breaking them into smaller chunks, loading only the necessary parts when they’re needed. This reduces the initial loading time for users, as they only download the essential code to render the initial view. Code splitting is particularly valuable in large applications where bundling everything together can lead to slow load times and performance issues.\n\nWe will explore various code splitting techniques, including their use cases and practical implementation examples.\n\n## Code splitting techniques\n\n### Entry point splitting\n\nEntry point splitting involves separating the main application entry points. In Webpack, you can specify multiple entry points, each generating a separate bundle. This technique is helpful in multi-page applications (MPAs) or if you have clearly separate sections within a single-page app (SPA) that can load independently.\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: {\n    home: './src/home.js',\n    dashboard: './src/dashboard.js',\n  },\n  output: {\n    filename: '[name].bundle.js',\n    path: __dirname + '/dist',\n  },\n}\n```\n\nHere, Webpack creates `home.bundle.js` and `dashboard.bundle.js`, loading only the necessary code when the user navigates to either the home page or dashboard.\n\n**Use case:**\n\n- Ideal for MPAs or complex SPAs where different parts of the app can load independently.\n\n### Route-based code splitting\n\nRoute-based code splitting is common in SPAs. Instead of loading the entire app at once, only the components needed for the current route are loaded initially. Additional routes are loaded only when the user navigates to them.\n\n**Example with React Router and React.lazy:**\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react'\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom'\n\nconst Home = lazy(() =\u003e import('./Home'))\nconst About = lazy(() =\u003e import('./About'))\nconst Contact = lazy(() =\u003e import('./Contact'))\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003cRouter\u003e\n      \u003cSuspense fallback={\u003cdiv\u003eLoading...\u003c/div\u003e}\u003e\n        \u003cSwitch\u003e\n          \u003cRoute path=\"/\" exact component={Home} /\u003e\n          \u003cRoute path=\"/about\" component={About} /\u003e\n          \u003cRoute path=\"/contact\" component={Contact} /\u003e\n        \u003c/Switch\u003e\n      \u003c/Suspense\u003e\n    \u003c/Router\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `React.lazy` dynamically imports each component.\n- `Suspense` shows a fallback (loading spinner) while the component loads.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- Reduces initial load time, as only the code for the first route is loaded.\n- Each route loads on demand, improving perceived performance for users.\n\n### Component-level code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense\n\nIf you have a large component that doesn’t need to load right away (e.g., a modal or sidebar), you can split it out and load it only when it’s needed. This helps reduce the initial bundle size, as non-essential components load asynchronously.\n\n**Example: Lazy Loading a Component**\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { lazy, Suspense, useState } from 'react'\n\nconst UserProfile = lazy(() =\u003e import('./UserProfile'))\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [showProfile, setShowProfile] = useState(false)\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setShowProfile((prev) =\u003e !prev)}\u003eToggle User Profile\u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003cSuspense fallback={\u003cdiv\u003eLoading...\u003c/div\u003e}\u003e{showProfile \u0026\u0026 \u003cUserProfile /\u003e}\u003c/Suspense\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The `UserProfile` component only loads when showProfile is true.\n- `Suspense` ensures that a fallback UI (loading spinner) is displayed while `UserProfile` is being loaded.\n\n**Use cases:**\n\n- Large, non-essential components such as modals, drawers, or other sections that users may not access right away.\n\n### Splitting large dependencies or utilities\n\nSometimes a single library or utility can significantly increase your bundle size. Instead of loading the entire library, use dynamic `import()` to load only the necessary part of the code when needed. This is particularly useful for utilities like date formatting or image processing libraries that may not be required on every page.\n\n**Example: Lazy Loading a utility library**\n\n```jsx\nfunction DateFormatter({ date }) {\n  const [formattedDate, setFormattedDate] = useState('')\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    async function loadDateLibrary() {\n      const { format } = await import('date-fns')\n      setFormattedDate(format(new Date(date), 'yyyy-MM-dd'))\n    }\n    loadDateLibrary()\n  }, [date])\n\n  return \u003cdiv\u003e{formattedDate}\u003c/div\u003e\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The date-fns library only loads when DateFormatter is rendered.\n- This avoids including the entire library in the initial bundle, saving on bundle size.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- Reduces initial load time by avoiding unnecessary libraries in the main bundle.\n- Load dependencies only when needed, improving performance and responsiveness.\n\n### Library-Based Code Splitting with `react-loadable`\n\nFor more complex loading scenarios, `react-loadable` offers additional features such as delayed loading, error boundaries, and preloading. It’s especially helpful if you want to provide a custom loading experience or handle loading errors gracefully.\n\n**Example using react-loadable**\n\n```jsx\nimport Loadable from 'react-loadable'\n\nconst LoadableComponent = Loadable({\n  loader: () =\u003e import('./HeavyComponent'),\n  loading: ({ isLoading, pastDelay, error }) =\u003e {\n    if (isLoading \u0026\u0026 pastDelay) return \u003cdiv\u003eLoading...\u003c/div\u003e\n    if (error) return \u003cdiv\u003eError loading component!\u003c/div\u003e\n    return null\n  },\n  delay: 300, // Shows loading only if loading takes longer than 300ms\n})\n\nfunction App() {\n  return \u003cLoadableComponent /\u003e\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `react-loadable` provides a loading component that displays based on certain conditions, such as past delay time or error occurrence.\n- This allows you to handle cases where loading might take a long time or fail altogether, providing a better user experience.\n\n**Use cases:**\n\n- Components that may take longer to load due to their size or network conditions.\n- Error-prone components that need error handling.\n\n## Advanced Code Splitting Techniques\n\n### Preloading and Prefetching Components\n\nPreloading and prefetching are useful when you want to load components in advance, either to improve performance or to anticipate user interactions.\n\n- **Preload**: Load code for a component in the background, without delaying the initial page load.\n- **Prefetch**: Load code when the user is likely to need it soon, based on user interaction patterns (e.g., hovering over a link).\n\n```jsx\nconst UserProfile = lazy(() =\u003e import(/* webpackPrefetch: true */ './UserProfile'))\n```\n\n**Use case:**\n\n- Preload the next route’s component in the background while the user is interacting with the current route.\n\n### Bundle Splitting\n\nBundling tools, such as Webpack, that have the `SplitChunksPlugin` component can be configured to automatically separate common dependencies (like react or lodash) into distinct bundles. This avoids redundant code in each chunk and reduces the total bundle size.\n\n**Example configuration in Webpack:**\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  optimization: {\n    splitChunks: {\n      chunks: 'all',\n      minSize: 30000,\n      maxSize: 50000,\n      cacheGroups: {\n        vendor: {\n          test: /[\\\\/]node_modules[\\\\/]/,\n          name: 'vendors',\n          chunks: 'all',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `SplitChunksPlugin` creates a vendors chunk with common dependencies, reducing redundancy and improving caching.\n\n**Use Case:**\n\n- In large applications with many shared dependencies.\n\n### Lazy loading images and assets\n\nFor non-JavaScript assets like images and fonts, you can also improve performance by loading them only when they’re in the viewport.\n\n**Example: Lazy Loading Images with `loading=\"lazy\"`**\n\n```jsx\nfunction ImageComponent() {\n  return \u003cimg src=\"path/to/image.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Lazy loaded image\" /\u003e\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The `loading=\"lazy\"` attribute ensures the image loads only when it’s about to enter the viewport.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- Reduces initial data transfer, helping pages load faster, especially when there are many images.\n\n### Summary\n\n| Technique                      | Best For                                                 | Examples                                               |\n| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Entry Point Splitting**      | Multi-page apps with separate entry points               | Home, Admin, Dashboard entry points                    |\n| **Route-Based Splitting**      | Single-page apps, lazy loading route components          | Lazy loading routes with React Router                  |\n| **Component-Level Splitting**  | Large components like modals, settings panels            | Lazy loading non-essential components                  |\n| **Large Dependency Splitting** | Libraries used infrequently                              | Date formatting utilities, large image processing libs |\n| **Library-Based Splitting**    | Components that need advanced loading/error handling     | `react-loadable` for complex loading states            |\n| **Preloading and Prefetching** | Anticipating user actions to improve UX                  | Preloading next route or component                     |\n| **Bundle Splitting**           | Avoiding redundancy by splitting common dependencies     | Splitting `vendors` bundle                             |\n| **Lazy Loading Images**        | Reducing initial page weight for media-rich applications | `loading=\"lazy\"` attribute on images                   |\n\nEach of these techniques targets a specific aspect of load management and bundle optimization, providing flexibility to load only what’s necessary. Applying them strategically improves both the initial load time and the user experience throughout the app, especially as users navigate or interact more deeply with various parts of the application.\n","title":"Code splitting in React","short_title":"Code splitting","description":"Optimize JavaScript performance with code splitting techniques like route-based splitting, lazy loading, and dynamic imports","tags":["react","performance"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh"],"date":"2024-10-29","filePath":"playground/frontend/react/code-splitting.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","react","code-splitting"]},{"content":"\nComponent composition patterns are foundational for creating scalable, flexible, and reusable React components. They allow us to build UIs by combining smaller, single-purpose components in various ways.\n\n## Key composition patterns in React\n\n### Higher-order components (HOCs)\n\nHOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component, adding additional functionality. They’re particularly useful for cross-cutting concerns like logging, analytics, or authentication.\n\n**Example use case**: Suppose you need to add logging functionality to multiple components. Instead of embedding logging code in each component, you create an HOC that wraps each component and handles the logging logic.\n\n```js\nfunction withLogging(WrappedComponent) {\n  return function EnhancedComponent(props) {\n    useEffect(() =\u003e {\n      console.log(`Component ${WrappedComponent.name} mounted`)\n    }, [])\n    return \u003cWrappedComponent {...props} /\u003e\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**When to use HOCs**:\n\n- For injecting props or shared behavior across multiple components.\n- To handle cross-cutting concerns that aren’t tightly coupled with the component’s core logic.\n- When you want to avoid prop drilling by creating an abstraction layer.\n\n**Trade-offs**:\n\n- Can lead to “wrapper hell” if overused.\n- Less popular with modern hooks as custom hooks can sometimes achieve similar results in a more straightforward way.\n\n### Render props\n\nWith render props, a component uses a prop as a function to control its output, allowing you to pass dynamic rendering logic.\n\n**Example use case**: If you have a `\u003cDataFetcher /\u003e` component that retrieves data, you could use render props to define how that data should be rendered by the consuming component.\n\n```js\nfunction DataFetcher({ render }) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null)\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    fetchData().then(setData)\n  }, [])\n  return render(data)\n}\n\n// Usage:\n;\u003cDataFetcher render={(data) =\u003e \u003cDisplayData data={data} /\u003e} /\u003e\n```\n\n**When to use render props**:\n\n- For providing control over how the child component renders data.\n- When the consuming component needs flexibility in rendering but also needs the data or logic encapsulated in the parent.\n\n**Trade-offs**:\n\n- Can lead to deeply nested code if not structured thoughtfully.\n- Not as widely used with hooks and context, which often simplify sharing functionality across components.\n\n### Compound components\n\nCompound components are components that work together as a single unit but allow for great customization of individual parts.\n\n**Example use case**: A `\u003cDropdown /\u003e` component that lets you use `\u003cDropdown.Toggle /\u003e` and `\u003cDropdown.Menu /\u003e` as children, giving flexibility to control each part while keeping the structure consistent.\n\n```js\nfunction Dropdown({ children }) {\n  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n  return (\n    \u003cDropdownContext.Provider value={{ isOpen, setIsOpen }}\u003e\n      \u003cdiv className=\"dropdown\"\u003e{children}\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/DropdownContext.Provider\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nDropdown.Toggle = function Toggle() {\n  const { setIsOpen } = useContext(DropdownContext)\n  return \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setIsOpen((open) =\u003e !open)}\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\n}\n\nDropdown.Menu = function Menu({ children }) {\n  const { isOpen } = useContext(DropdownContext)\n  return isOpen ? \u003cdiv className=\"menu\"\u003e{children}\u003c/div\u003e : null\n}\n```\n\n**When to use compound components**:\n\n- When you have related components that need to work together in a coordinated way but require customization for each part.\n- Especially effective for components like modals, tabs, or dropdowns.\n\n**Trade-offs**:\n\n- Requires careful management of context to avoid coupling.\n- If the API isn’t intuitive, can be confusing for developers unfamiliar with the compound pattern.\n\n### Controlled and uncontrolled components\n\nControlled components let the parent manage the state, whereas uncontrolled components manage their own state internally. Combining them allows more flexibility in form components.\n\n**Example use case**: A `\u003cTextInput /\u003e` component that can work either as a controlled component (with value and onChange passed from the parent) or an uncontrolled component (handling its own state).\n\n```js\nfunction TextInput({ value, defaultValue, onChange }) {\n    const [internalValue, setInternalValue] = useState(defaultValue);\n    const isControlled = value !== undefined;\n\n    const handleChange = (e) =\u003e {\n        const newValue = e.target.value;\n        if (isControlled) {\n            onChange(newValue);\n        } else {\n            setInternalValue(newValue);\n        }\n    };\n\n    return (\n        \u003cinput\n            value={isControlled ? value : internalValue}\n            onChange={handleChange}\n        /\u003e\n    );\n}\n\n// Usage:\n\u003cTextInput defaultValue=\"Uncontrolled\" /\u003e\n\u003cTextInput value={controlledValue} onChange={setControlledValue} /\u003e\n```\n\n**When to use controlled and uncontrolled components**:\n\n- Controlled components are essential for forms or any element that requires data validation.\n- Uncontrolled components are more performant and simpler for elements without validation needs.\n\n**Trade-offs**:\n\n- Controlled components can lead to performance issues in large forms.\n- Uncontrolled components lack flexibility for handling validation or dynamic data flow.\n\n### Custom hooks\n\nCustom hooks provide a way to abstract and encapsulate complex logic, making components more modular and readable. They can be used in place of certain HOCs and render props for handling things like async data, complex state, or side effects.\n\n**Example use case**: If you frequently need to fetch data in multiple components, a `useFetch` custom hook encapsulates this logic, making the components cleaner and more testable.\n\n```js\nfunction useFetch(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null)\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    fetch(url)\n      .then((response) =\u003e response.json())\n      .then(setData)\n  }, [url])\n  return data\n}\n```\n\n**When to use custom hooks**:\n\n- When encapsulating side effects, data fetching, or complex state logic.\n- As a more readable and flexible alternative to HOCs and render props.\n\n**Trade-offs**:\n\n- Dependency management in hooks can be tricky, especially with complex dependencies.\n- Not ideal for injecting UI-related functionality that might be easier to handle with HOCs or render props.\n\n## Choosing the right pattern\n\nSelecting the right pattern often depends on:\n\n- **Complexity of data flow**: If your data flow is complex, consider compound components or render props.\n- **Component reusability**: HOCs are ideal for reusable logic across unrelated components.\n- **Level of control**: Controlled/uncontrolled patterns are great for balancing simplicity and flexibility in form handling.\n","title":"Component composition patterns in React","short_title":"Component composition patterns","description":"Learn React composition patterns with coverage of HOCs, render props, compound components, and custom hook","tags":["react"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh"],"date":"2024-10-29","filePath":"playground/frontend/react/component-composition-patterns.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","react","component-composition-patterns"]},{"content":"\nDesign system integration in React involves creating a set of reusable, consistent, and easily maintainable components that reflect your app’s design guidelines. Integrating a design system helps ensure visual and functional consistency across your application while allowing for scalability as new components and features are added. Design systems often include UI components, design tokens, typography, colors, icons, spacing guidelines, and accessibility standards.\n\n**Key steps and concepts for design system integration in react**\n\n1. Define the core design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)\n2. Build atomic components (buttons, inputs, typography)\n3. Create composable, flexible components\n4. Establish and use a component library framework (Storybook)\n5. Implement accessibility standards\n6. Use context and theming for adaptable designs\n\n### 1. Define core design tokens\n\n**Design tokens** are the fundamental building blocks of your design system. They represent design decisions like colors, typography, and spacing in a consistent, reusable format. By defining tokens, you create a single source of truth that makes updates and adjustments easy across the app.\n\n**Example: Design tokens in a JSON format**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"colors\": {\n    \"primary\": \"#007bff\",\n    \"secondary\": \"#6c757d\",\n    \"background\": \"#f8f9fa\",\n    \"text\": \"#212529\"\n  },\n  \"typography\": {\n    \"fontFamily\": \"Arial, sans-serif\",\n    \"fontSize\": {\n      \"small\": \"12px\",\n      \"medium\": \"16px\",\n      \"large\": \"24px\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"spacing\": {\n    \"small\": \"4px\",\n    \"medium\": \"8px\",\n    \"large\": \"16px\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can then access and apply these tokens in your components, ensuring they follow consistent visual guidelines.\n\n**In a React component:**\n\n```js\nimport tokens from './tokens.json'\n\nconst Button = ({ children }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cbutton\n    style={{\n      backgroundColor: tokens.colors.primary,\n      color: tokens.colors.background,\n      padding: tokens.spacing.medium,\n      fontSize: tokens.typography.fontSize.medium,\n      fontFamily: tokens.typography.fontFamily,\n    }}\n  \u003e\n    {children}\n  \u003c/button\u003e\n)\n```\n\n### 2. Build atomic components\n\nAtomic design breaks down UI elements into **atoms**, **molecules**, **organisms**, **templates**, and **pages**. This approach helps in building reusable, low-level components that can be combined and customized to create more complex components and layouts.\n\n**Atomic design hierarchy:**\n\n- **Atoms**: Smallest, single-purpose components like buttons, inputs, or labels.\n- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms, such as an input field with a label.\n- **Organisms**: Groups of molecules that form distinct sections, like a header or a form.\n- **Templates and pages**: Higher-level layouts or complete screens that use organisms and molecules.\n\n**Example: Button component (atom)**\n\n```jsx\nconst Button = ({ label, onClick, variant = 'primary' }) =\u003e {\n  const styles = {\n    primary: {\n      backgroundColor: tokens.colors.primary,\n      color: tokens.colors.background,\n    },\n    secondary: {\n      backgroundColor: tokens.colors.secondary,\n      color: tokens.colors.background,\n    },\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cbutton style={styles[variant]} onClick={onClick}\u003e\n      {label}\n    \u003c/button\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Example: Form component (molecule)**\n\n```jsx\nconst FormField = ({ label, type = 'text', value, onChange }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003clabel\u003e{label}\u003c/label\u003e\n    \u003cinput type={type} value={value} onChange={onChange} /\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n)\n```\n\n### 3. Create composable, flexible components\n\nDesign systems benefit from **flexible components** that can adapt to different use cases without being overly rigid. Use **props** and **styled-system** libraries (e.g., styled-components or emotion) to make your components customizable.\n\n```jsx\nimport styled from 'styled-components'\nimport tokens from './tokens.json'\n\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  padding: ${tokens.spacing.medium};\n  font-size: ${tokens.typography.fontSize.medium};\n  color: ${({ variant }) =\u003e tokens.colors[variant]};\n  background-color: ${({ bg }) =\u003e bg || tokens.colors.background};\n`\n```\n\nThis approach allows the Button component to be reusable, enabling different colors and backgrounds with minimal code.\n\n### 4. Establish and use a component library framework (Storybook)\n\n[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a popular tool for creating isolated component libraries, documenting components, and allowing team members to interact with components outside of the application environment.\n\n**Set up Storybook**\n\nInstall Storybook in your React project.\n\n```sh\nnpx sb init\n```\n\n**Write stories for components**\n\nEach component should have its own story, describing its appearance with various props and states.\n\n```jsx\n// Example: Button.stories.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { Button } from './Button'\n\nexport default {\n  title: 'Design system/Button',\n  component: Button,\n}\n\nexport const Primary = () =\u003e \u003cButton variant=\"primary\" label=\"Primary Button\" /\u003e\nexport const Secondary = () =\u003e \u003cButton variant=\"secondary\" label=\"Secondary Button\" /\u003e\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- Provides a single source of truth for UI components, where designers and developers can collaborate.\n- Enables interactive testing of each component’s variations, ensuring they meet design requirements.\n- Encourages consistency across components, as each component variation is clearly documented.\n\n### 5. Implement accessibility standards\n\nDesign systems must prioritize accessibility to create inclusive applications. Follow **WCAG guidelines** and use accessible components, ensuring that all users can interact with your app.\n\n- **Color contrast**: Use tokens that meet accessibility standards for contrast. Tools like axe can test for color contrast and other accessibility issues.\n\n- **Aria roles and attributes**: Use ARIA attributes for interactive components like buttons, modals, and dialogs to improve screen reader support.\n\n```jsx\n// Example: Accessible button with ARIA\nconst Button = ({ label, onClick, ariaLabel, variant = 'primary' }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cbutton onClick={onClick} style={{ backgroundColor: tokens.colors[variant] }} aria-label={ariaLabel}\u003e\n    {label}\n  \u003c/button\u003e\n)\n```\n\n- **Keyboard navigation**: Ensure that all components can be navigated via keyboard. Focus management is crucial, especially for modal dialogs or dynamic components like carousels.\n\n```jsx\n// Example: Focus management in a modal\nimport { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'\n\nconst Modal = ({ isOpen, onClose, children }) =\u003e {\n  const closeButtonRef = useRef()\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    if (isOpen) {\n      closeButtonRef.current.focus()\n    }\n  }, [isOpen])\n\n  return isOpen ? (\n    \u003cdiv role=\"dialog\" aria-modal=\"true\" tabIndex={-1}\u003e\n      \u003cbutton ref={closeButtonRef} onClick={onClose}\u003e\n        Close\n      \u003c/button\u003e\n      {children}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  ) : null\n}\n```\n\nTools:\n\n- `axe-core` and `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` for testing accessibility issues.\n- `Storybook accessibility addon` to validate and fix issues while developing components.\n\n### 6. Use context and theming for adaptable designs\n\nTo support **themes** (e.g., dark and light modes), use **context providers** to pass theme values down to components. This enables consistent theming and allows the user to switch themes easily.\n\n**Example: Theming with context**\n\n1. Create theme context:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react'\nimport tokens from './tokens.json'\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext()\n\nexport const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) =\u003e {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light')\n\n  const toggleTheme = () =\u003e setTheme((prev) =\u003e (prev === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'))\n\n  const themeStyles = theme === 'light' ? tokens.light : tokens.dark\n\n  return \u003cThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, themeStyles, toggleTheme }}\u003e{children}\u003c/ThemeContext.Provider\u003e\n}\n\nexport const useTheme = () =\u003e useContext(ThemeContext)\n```\n\n2. Consume theme context in components:\n\n```jsx\nconst ThemedButton = ({ label }) =\u003e {\n  const { themeStyles } = useTheme()\n  return (\n    \u003cbutton\n      style={{\n        backgroundColor: themeStyles.colors.primary,\n        color: themeStyles.colors.background,\n      }}\n    \u003e\n      {label}\n    \u003c/button\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n3. Switch themes in app:\n\n```jsx\nfunction App() {\n  const { toggleTheme } = useTheme()\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cThemedButton label=\"Click me\" /\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={toggleTheme}\u003eToggle Theme\u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n| Technique                           | Purpose                                                                                  |\n| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Design tokens**                   | Centralize colors, typography, and spacing for consistent styling                        |\n| **Atomic components**               | Build scalable, reusable components from basic building blocks                           |\n| **Composable, flexible components** | Ensure flexibility for various use cases using props and dynamic styling                 |\n| **Storybook**                       | Document, test, and showcase all components, ensuring design and functionality alignment |\n| **Accessibility standards**         | Improve usability for all users, following WCAG and ARIA best practices                  |\n| **Context and theming**             | Support adaptable designs, allowing for light and dark themes or other custom themes     |\n\nBy integrating these techniques, you can build a design system that is robust, adaptable, and consistent, making it easier to scale and maintain the UI over time.\n","title":"Design system integration in react","short_title":"Design system integration","description":"Learn how to integrate design systems in React applications with comprehensive coverage of design tokens, atomic components, and accessibility standards.","tags":["react","design-system","storybook"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh"],"date":"2024-10-29","filePath":"playground/frontend/react/design-system-integration.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","react","design-system-integration"]},{"content":"\nHooks architecture in React refers to the systematic approach of using hooks to manage state, side effects, and reusable logic across components. **Custom hooks** are one of the most powerful features, allowing you to encapsulate and reuse complex logic independently of component structure. Custom hooks improve code readability, keep components lean, and make stateful logic portable and composable.\n\n### Key concepts in hooks architecture\n\n- Separation of concerns with custom hooks\n- Encapsulating side effects\n- Dependency management in hooks\n- Combining multiple custom hooks\n\n### Separation of concerns with custom hooks\n\nBy creating custom hooks, we can isolate specific pieces of logic or state, making components simpler and easier to test. Custom hooks follow the same naming conventions and usage patterns as built-in hooks but encapsulate domain-specific or app-specific logic.\n\n**Example: `useFetch` hook for data fetching**\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n\nfunction useFetch(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null)\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null)\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    setLoading(true)\n    fetch(url)\n      .then((response) =\u003e response.json())\n      .then((data) =\u003e setData(data))\n      .catch((error) =\u003e setError(error))\n      .finally(() =\u003e setLoading(false))\n  }, [url])\n\n  return { data, loading, error }\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```js\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const { data, loading, error } = useFetch(`/api/users/${userId}`)\n\n  if (loading) return \u003cp\u003eLoading...\u003c/p\u003e\n  if (error) return \u003cp\u003eError loading data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  return \u003cdiv\u003e{data.name}\u003c/div\u003e\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- **Reusability**: The `useFetch` hook can be used in any component needing data from an API.\n- **Isolation of concerns**: Data fetching logic is isolated, keeping components focused on UI and presentation.\n\n### Encapsulating side effects\n\nSide effects (like fetching data, managing subscriptions, or setting timeouts) often clutter component code. By moving these side effects into custom hooks, we can encapsulate the logic and improve component readability.\n\n**Example: `useDocumentTitle` hook for updating the document title**\n\n```js\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\n\nfunction useDocumentTitle(title) {\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    document.title = title\n  }, [title])\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```js\nfunction HomePage() {\n  useDocumentTitle('Home - My App')\n  return \u003cdiv\u003eWelcome to the Home Page\u003c/div\u003e\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- **Isolation of side effects**: The document title logic is separate from the component's main UI, simplifying the component.\n- **Reusability**: `useDocumentTitle` can be reused across pages or components that need to set the document title.\n\n### Dependency management in hooks\n\nCustom hooks require careful handling of dependencies to avoid bugs, stale data, or unintended behaviors. `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` hooks depend on stable dependencies to function predictably.\n\n**Example: Managing dependencies with `useMemo`**\n\nSuppose we need to calculate an expensive value in a hook, which depends on certain props or state. Using `useMemo` ensures the computation only runs when necessary.\n\n```js\nimport { useMemo } from 'react'\n\nfunction useExpensiveCalculation(data) {\n  const result = useMemo(() =\u003e {\n    // Expensive calculation here\n    return data.reduce((sum, num) =\u003e sum + num, 0)\n  }, [data])\n\n  return result\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```js\nfunction Stats({ numbers }) {\n  const total = useExpensiveCalculation(numbers)\n  return \u003cdiv\u003eTotal: {total}\u003c/div\u003e\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- **Efficiency**: By memoizing the result, we avoid recalculating every render, improving performance.\n- **Stable dependencies**: Carefully setting dependencies ensures the calculation only reruns when `data` changes.\n\n\u003e In the future, this step will be handled automatically by [React compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler#what-does-the-compiler-do)\n\n### Combining multiple custom hooks\n\nFor more complex scenarios, multiple custom hooks can be combined, keeping components modular and avoiding deeply nested hooks. You can chain hooks to build up increasingly complex functionality without cluttering a single hook.\n\n**Example: Using `useAuth` and `useFetch` together**\n\n```js\n// useAuth.js import { useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction useAuth() {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null)\n\n  const login = (userData) =\u003e setUser(userData)\n  const logout = () =\u003e setUser(null)\n\n  return { user, login, logout }\n}\n\n// useUserData.js import useFetch from \"./useFetch\";\n\nfunction useUserData(userId) {\n  const { data, loading, error } = useFetch(`/api/users/${userId}`)\n  return { data, loading, error }\n}\n\n// Usage in a component\n\nfunction Dashboard({ userId }) {\n  const { user, login, logout } = useAuth()\n  const { data: userData, loading } = useUserData(userId)\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      {user ? (\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n          \u003cbutton onClick={logout}\u003eLogout\u003c/button\u003e\n          {loading ? \u003cp\u003eLoading user data...\u003c/p\u003e : \u003cp\u003eWelcome, {userData.name}\u003c/p\u003e}\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n      ) : (\n        \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e login({ id: userId, name: 'John Doe' })}\u003eLogin\u003c/button\u003e\n      )}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- **Modularity**: Each hook handles a specific concern (auth or fetching data), so they're independently reusable and testable.\n- **Encapsulation**: The component doesn't need to understand the logic inside each hook, only the returned data and functions.\n\n### Best practices for custom hooks\n\n**Use clear naming conventions**: Name hooks descriptively, starting with `use`, such as `useAuth`, `useFetchData`, or `useToggle`. This helps with readability and code consistency.\n\n**Return only necessary data and functions**: Custom hooks should return only the data and functions the component actually needs. This minimizes the hook's API surface and reduces complexity.\n\n```js\n// Better: return only what's needed\nfunction useToggle(initialState = false) {\n  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)\n  const toggle = () =\u003e setState((prev) =\u003e !prev)\n  return [state, toggle]\n}\n```\n\n**Handle edge cases and errors gracefully**: Build error handling directly into hooks, where applicable. This keeps components from dealing with low-level error handling, focusing only on displaying relevant information to the user.\n\n```js\nfunction useFetch(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null)\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null)\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    fetch(url)\n      .then((response) =\u003e response.json())\n      .then(setData)\n      .catch(setError)\n  }, [url])\n\n  return { data, error }\n}\n```\n\n**Encapsulate complex state logic**: If you find yourself managing complex state logic (e.g., multiple variables, resetting state), consider using `useReducer` within the hook.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useReducer } from 'react'\n\nfunction formReducer(state, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'update':\n      return { ...state, [action.field]: action.value }\n    case 'reset':\n      return action.initialState\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction useForm(initialState) {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(formReducer, initialState)\n\n  const updateField = (field, value) =\u003e dispatch({ type: 'update', field, value })\n  const resetForm = () =\u003e dispatch({ type: 'reset', initialState })\n\n  return [state, updateField, resetForm]\n}\n```\n\n**Testing custom hooks**: Test custom hooks in isolation to ensure they behave as expected under various scenarios. Tools like **React testing library's `renderHook`** make it easy to test hooks directly.\n\n```js\nimport { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks'\nimport useToggle from './useToggle'\n\ntest('should toggle state', () =\u003e {\n  const { result } = renderHook(() =\u003e useToggle())\n\n  act(() =\u003e {\n    result.current[1]() // Call toggle function\n  })\n\n  expect(result.current[0]).toBe(true) // Assert the toggled state\n})\n```\n\n### Combining techniques in a custom hook system\n\nImagine you need a custom hook system for managing user authentication, including login, logout, fetching user data, and handling user permissions. We'll create modular hooks that interact but remain individually reusable.\n\n1.  **`useAuth` for authentication**: Manages login and logout functions and holds user session data.\n2.  **`useUserData` for data fetching**: Fetches user-specific data from the server.\n3.  **`usePermissions` for role-based access**: Checks permissions based on the user's roles.\n\n**Combining custom hooks**:\n\n```js\n// useAuth.js\nfunction useAuth() {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null)\n\n  const login = (userData) =\u003e setUser(userData)\n  const logout = () =\u003e setUser(null)\n\n  return { user, login, logout }\n}\n\n// useUserData.js\nimport useFetch from './useFetch'\n\nfunction useUserData(userId) {\n  const { data, loading, error } = useFetch(`/api/users/${userId}`)\n  return { data, loading, error }\n}\n\n// usePermissions.js\nfunction usePermissions(userRoles = []) {\n  const hasPermission = (permission) =\u003e userRoles.includes(permission)\n  return { hasPermission }\n}\n\n// Usage in a component\nfunction AdminDashboard({ userId }) {\n  const { user, login, logout } = useAuth()\n  const { data: userData, loading: dataLoading } = useUserData(userId)\n  const { hasPermission } = usePermissions(userData ? userData.roles : [])\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      {user ? (\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n          \u003cbutton onClick={logout}\u003eLogout\u003c/button\u003e\n          {dataLoading ? \u003cp\u003eLoading user data...\u003c/p\u003e : hasPermission('admin') ? \u003cp\u003eWelcome, Admin {userData.name}\u003c/p\u003e : \u003cp\u003eAccess denied\u003c/p\u003e}\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n      ) : (\n        \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e login({ id: userId, name: 'Jane Doe' })}\u003eLogin\u003c/button\u003e\n      )}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nBy modularizing each piece of the authentication system into separate custom hooks, we ensure that each hook is individually testable, reusable, and manageable. This approach keeps the `AdminDashboard` component focused on rendering, with minimal logic.\n\n### Summary\n\nCustom hooks provide a powerful way to architect stateful and reusable logic in React applications. By following best practices and focusing on modularity, you can create hooks that are easy to test, maintain, and scale across complex applications. The approach to combining, organizing, and testing these hooks leads to clean, efficient, and high-quality code.\n","title":"Hook architecture in react","short_title":"Hook architecture","description":"React hooks architecture with in-depth coverage of custom hooks, state management, and side effects handling.","tags":["react","hook"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh"],"date":"2024-10-29","filePath":"playground/frontend/react/hook-architecture.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","react","hook-architecture"]},{"content":"\nClient-side rendering (CSR), server-side rendering (SSR), and static-site generation (SSG) are three key rendering strategies in modern web development. Each approach has unique advantages and trade-offs, impacting application performance, SEO, and user experience.\n\n### Client-side rendering (CSR)\n\nCSR is the default rendering approach in React applications, where everything from data fetching to rendering happens in the browser. The server delivers a minimal HTML file with a JavaScript bundle, and React takes over from there, rendering the content on the client's side.\n\n#### How it works\n\n- The browser downloads the JavaScript bundle, which contains the React code.\n- React builds the UI on the client by executing the JavaScript code.\n- Data fetching happens after the page loads, potentially leading to a delay before content appears.\n\n#### Advantages\n\n- **Fast initial deployment**: Easier to deploy and manage since there's no server-rendering setup.\n- **Rich interactivity**: Great for SPAs (single page applications) with dynamic, highly interactive UI elements.\n- **Simplified development**: Client-side data fetching and rendering simplify development in many scenarios.\n\n#### Disadvantages\n\n- **Initial load time**: Users may experience a blank page or loading spinner until the JavaScript bundle downloads and renders.\n- **SEO challenges**: Since the HTML is minimal, search engines may struggle to crawl and index content, although some modern crawlers can render JavaScript.\n- **Performance**: Large bundles can lead to slow page load times, especially on low-bandwidth connections.\n\n#### Example in React\n\nIn CSR, data fetching happens on the client side, typically using hooks like `useEffect`.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null)\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`)\n      .then((response) =\u003e response.json())\n      .then((data) =\u003e setUser(data))\n  }, [userId])\n\n  return user ? \u003cdiv\u003e{user.name}\u003c/div\u003e : \u003cdiv\u003eLoading...\u003c/div\u003e\n}\n```\n\n### Server-side rendering (SSR)\n\nSSR generates HTML on the server for each request. When the user requests a page, the server processes the JavaScript, fetches any necessary data, and returns a fully-rendered HTML page. React components are rendered to HTML strings on the server and sent to the client, where React \"hydrates\" (attaches event listeners) to the HTML.\n\n#### How it works\n\n- The server generates HTML with the initial content and sends it to the client.\n- The client receives a fully-rendered HTML page and hydrates it, enabling interactivity.\n- Additional JavaScript for further user interactions loads in the background.\n\n#### Advantages\n\n- **Improved SEO**: The initial HTML page is fully rendered, making it easily crawlable by search engines.\n- **Faster time to interactive (TTI)**: The user sees the fully-rendered content sooner, as it doesn't rely solely on client-side JavaScript for initial render.\n- **Content accessibility**: Even users on slow networks or with JavaScript disabled can see the initial page content.\n\n#### Disadvantages\n\n- **Server load**: Each request requires the server to render the page, increasing server workload, especially with many requests.\n- **Complexity**: Requires server infrastructure and additional setup, which can increase complexity.\n- **Hydration time**: The browser still needs to download JavaScript and hydrate the page, which can create a slight delay for interactivity.\n\n#### Example in Next.js\n\nNext.js is a React framework that simplifies SSR. With Next.js, you can use `getServerSideProps` to fetch data and render it on the server.\n\n```jsx\n// pages/profile/[id].js\n\nimport React from 'react'\n\nexport async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n  const { id } = context.params\n  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${id}`)\n  const user = await res.json()\n\n  return { props: { user } }\n}\n\nexport default function UserProfile({ user }) {\n  return \u003cdiv\u003e{user.name}\u003c/div\u003e\n}\n```\n\n### Static-site generation (SSG)\n\nSSG generates HTML at build time. Unlike SSR, which renders HTML on each request, SSG pre-renders pages as static files and serves them on request. This is ideal for content that doesn't change frequently, as it combines the benefits of SSR with the speed of serving static files.\n\n#### How it works\n\n- The pages are pre-rendered at build time, creating static HTML files.\n- When a user requests a page, the server serves the static HTML directly from a CDN or hosting server.\n- Any dynamic content or interactivity can be added client-side, often using JavaScript to fetch data or modify the UI after load.\n\n#### Advantages\n\n- **Fast performance**: Since the pages are static files, they load very quickly from a CDN or server.\n- **SEO-friendly**: Like SSR, the static HTML is crawlable by search engines.\n- **Low server load**: No need to generate HTML per request, reducing server resources.\n\n#### Disadvantages\n\n- **Less flexibility**: Pages are generated at build time, so content updates require a new build and deployment.\n- **Not ideal for highly dynamic content**: SSG is less suitable for frequently changing content, as updates won't appear until the next build.\n- **Extra build time**: Large sites can have long build times if each page needs to be generated statically.\n\n#### Example in Next.js\n\nIn Next.js, `getStaticProps` generates static pages at build time. This is perfect for content like blog posts or product pages.\n\n```jsx\n// pages/posts/[id].js\n\nimport React from 'react'\n\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n\n  return { props: { post } }\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n\n  const paths = posts.map((post) =\u003e ({\n    params: { id: post.id.toString() },\n  }))\n\n  return { paths, fallback: false }\n}\n\nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  return \u003cdiv\u003e{post.title}\u003c/div\u003e\n}\n```\n\n### Comparing CSR, SSR, and SSG\n\n| Feature               | CSR (client-side rendering)                     | SSR (server-side rendering)                             | SSG (static-site generation)                      |\n| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Data fetching**     | Client-side (after page load)                   | Server-side (on each request)                           | Server-side (at build time)                       |\n| **Rendering**         | Browser                                         | Server for initial, browser for subsequent interactions | Server at build time, browser for interactions    |\n| **Best for**          | Highly interactive apps, SPAs                   | SEO-sensitive, frequently updated content               | Static content, rarely changing pages             |\n| **SEO**               | Limited SEO (due to initial blank HTML)         | Great SEO (initial HTML contains full content)          | Great SEO (pre-rendered HTML at build time)       |\n| **Initial load time** | Depends on bundle size, slower initial load     | Faster initial load, HTML is pre-rendered               | Fastest (serving static files), low latency       |\n| **Content freshness** | Real-time updates                               | Real-time updates                                       | Stale until next build                            |\n| **Hosting cost**      | Lower hosting cost (only needs a static server) | Higher hosting cost (server processes each request)     | Lower hosting cost (can use CDN for static files) |\n\n### Choosing between CSR, SSR, and SSG\n\n- **CSR** is best for SPAs or applications with highly interactive interfaces that don't rely heavily on SEO, such as dashboards and internal tools.\n- **SSR** is suitable for applications that require both SEO and dynamic content, like e-commerce sites or blogs with frequently updated content.\n- **SSG** is ideal for static content that doesn't change often, like documentation sites, blog pages, or marketing landing pages.\n\n### Combining CSR, SSR, and SSG\n\nIn some cases, applications use a **hybrid approach** to leverage the strengths of each technique. For instance:\n\n- **Next.js** allows you to use SSG for pages with static content, SSR for dynamic pages, and CSR for client-specific interactions.\n- **Incremental static regeneration (ISR)** in Next.js enables automatic regeneration of static pages at a specified interval, combining the benefits of SSG and SSR for frequently updated content.\n\n**Example hybrid approach in Next.js**\n\nIn this example, we use SSG with ISR for product pages and CSR for interactive features like adding items to a cart.\n\n```jsx\n// pages/product/[id].js\n\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/products/${params.id}`)\n  const product = await res.json()\n\n  return { props: { product }, revalidate: 60 } // ISR: regenerates every 60 seconds\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/products')\n  const products = await res.json()\n\n  const paths = products.map((product) =\u003e ({\n    params: { id: product.id.toString() },\n  }))\n\n  return { paths, fallback: 'blocking' }\n}\n\nexport default function Product({ product }) {\n  const [cart, setCart] = useState([])\n\n  const addToCart = () =\u003e {\n    setCart((prevCart) =\u003e [...prevCart, product])\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003e{product.name}\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={addToCart}\u003eAdd to Cart\u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n- **SSG with ISR** serves the product page with updated data every 60 seconds.\n- **CSR** is used for the cart functionality, allowing client-side interactions without reloading the page.\n\n### Summary\n\nChoosing between CSR, SSR, and SSG depends on your application's needs for SEO, content freshness, interactivity, and performance. In many modern apps, a hybrid approach allows you to take advantage of each strategy where it's most beneficial, creating a fast, SEO-friendly, and interactive experience. Leveraging frameworks like Next.js simplifies managing these different rendering methods in a single React application, making it easier to build performant, user-friendly applications.\n","title":"Rendering strategies in React","short_title":"Rendering strategies","description":"React rendering strategies with in-depth coverage of client-side rendering (CSR), server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG).","tags":["react"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh"],"date":"2024-10-29","filePath":"playground/frontend/react/rendering-strategies.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","react","rendering-strategies"]},{"content":"\nState management is a core architectural topic in React, especially as applications grow in complexity. While local component state (using `useState` or `useReducer`) is suitable for small to medium apps, more sophisticated state management strategies become essential as your app scales.\n\n### Local component state with hooks\n\nReact’s native `useState` and `useReducer` are sufficient for managing state at the component level and are efficient for isolated, reusable components. However, challenges arise when dealing with deeply nested or cross-component data dependencies.\n\n**Example use case**\n\nUse `useReducer` for managing local form state with multiple dependent fields.\n\n```js\nconst initialFormState = { name: '', email: '', password: '' }\n\nfunction formReducer(state, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'UPDATE_FIELD':\n      return { ...state, [action.field]: action.value }\n    case 'RESET':\n      return initialFormState\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction SignupForm() {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(formReducer, initialFormState)\n\n  const handleChange = (e) =\u003e {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'UPDATE_FIELD',\n      field: e.target.name,\n      value: e.target.value,\n    })\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform\u003e\n      \u003cinput name=\"name\" value={state.name} onChange={handleChange} /\u003e\n      \u003cinput name=\"email\" value={state.email} onChange={handleChange} /\u003e\n      \u003cinput name=\"password\" type=\"password\" value={state.password} onChange={handleChange} /\u003e\n      \u003cbutton type=\"button\" onClick={() =\u003e dispatch({ type: 'RESET' })}\u003e\n        Reset\n      \u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**When to use local state**:\n\n- Isolated components with minimal data dependencies.\n- Simple, short-lived UI states, such as form inputs, toggles, or animations.\n\n### Global state with context API\n\nThe React Context API is suitable for small to medium global state needs, such as user authentication or theme settings. It’s lightweight but can cause re-rendering issues if used improperly in large applications.\n\n**Example of centralized authentication state**\n\n```jsx\nconst AuthContext = React.createContext()\n\nfunction AuthProvider({ children }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null)\n\n  const login = (userData) =\u003e setUser(userData)\n  const logout = () =\u003e setUser(null)\n\n  return \u003cAuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout }}\u003e{children}\u003c/AuthContext.Provider\u003e\n}\n\nfunction useAuth() {\n  return useContext(AuthContext)\n}\n\n// Usage:\nfunction Navbar() {\n  const { user, logout } = useAuth()\n  return user ? \u003cbutton onClick={logout}\u003eLogout\u003c/button\u003e : \u003cbutton\u003eLogin\u003c/button\u003e\n}\n```\n\n**When to use context API**:\n\n- Lightweight global state, like theme, user, or language settings.\n- Avoid for complex or frequently updated data, as it can lead to excessive re-renders.\n\n### Redux or Zustand for complex global state\n\nRedux is well-suited for applications with highly structured, complex, or cross-cutting state needs. It provides predictable state management via a single store and supports middleware for logging, async actions, and more. Alternatively, **Zustand** is a lightweight state management library that’s simpler to set up and more flexible than Redux.\n\n**Example of global cart management with Redux Toolkit**\n\nUsing Redux Toolkit, you can simplify Redux by automatically generating action creators and reducers.\n\n```js\nimport { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\n\nconst cartSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'cart',\n  initialState: [],\n  reducers: {\n    addItem: (state, action) =\u003e {\n      state.push(action.payload)\n    },\n    removeItem: (state, action) =\u003e {\n      return state.filter((item) =\u003e item.id !== action.payload)\n    },\n  },\n})\n\nconst store = configureStore({ reducer: { cart: cartSlice.reducer } })\n\n// Actions for dispatching:\nexport const { addItem, removeItem } = cartSlice.actions\nexport default store\n```\n\n**Redux vs. Zustand**:\n\n- **Redux**: More verbose but provides structure, middleware support, and a strong ecosystem (dev tools, middleware for async actions).\n- **Zustand**: Minimal boilerplate, straightforward API, and avoids creating a global Redux-like store by encouraging state encapsulation.\n\n**When to use Redux or Zustand**:\n\n- Cross-cutting data dependencies that multiple components need access to.\n- Scenarios that benefit from immutability (Redux) or a reactive, hook-based approach (Zustand).\n\n### Async data and server state with React Query or SWR\n\nTools like `React Query` and `SWR` are ideal for handling server data. They help manage caching, re-fetching, and synchronization with server data, which is particularly useful in data-intensive applications.\n\n**Example use case**: React Query simplifies handling server state by caching data and re-fetching when necessary. It also manages states like loading, error, and refetching automatically.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useQuery, QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from 'react-query'\n\nconst queryClient = new QueryClient()\n\nfunction fetchUser(userId) {\n  return fetch(`/api/user/${userId}`).then((res) =\u003e res.json())\n}\n\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(['user', userId], () =\u003e fetchUser(userId), {\n    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // Data remains fresh for 5 minutes\n  })\n\n  if (isLoading) return \u003cLoadingSpinner /\u003e\n  if (error) return \u003cErrorDisplay message={error.message} /\u003e\n  return \u003cdiv\u003eUser: {data.name}\u003c/div\u003e\n}\n\n// Usage in App:\n;\u003cQueryClientProvider client={queryClient}\u003e\n  \u003cUserProfile userId={1} /\u003e\n\u003c/QueryClientProvider\u003e\n```\n\n**React Query vs. SWR**:\n\n- **React Query**: More feature-rich and configurable; supports pagination, optimistic updates, and complex cache invalidation.\n- **SWR**: Lightweight with a more declarative approach; suitable for simpler use cases.\n\n**When to use React Query or SWR**:\n\n- Server-side data that needs caching, synchronization, and refresh-on-focus.\n- Use React Query for applications with complex server data dependencies and SWR for simpler needs.\n\n### Combined approach with context + React Query\n\nFor scalable applications, a hybrid approach works well, where:\n\n- Context handles small, rarely-changing global state (like theme or user settings).\n- React Query or SWR manages server state (API data).\n- Local state and custom hooks organize isolated or ephemeral component-specific state.\n\n**Example hybrid structure**:\n\n```jsx\nconst UserContext = React.createContext()\n\nfunction AppProvider({ children }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null)\n  return \u003cUserContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}\u003e{children}\u003c/UserContext.Provider\u003e\n}\n\nfunction useUserData(userId) {\n  return useQuery(['user', userId], () =\u003e fetchUser(userId), { staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000 })\n}\n\nfunction UserComponent() {\n  const { user, setUser } = useContext(UserContext)\n  const { data: userData } = useUserData(user.id)\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    if (userData) setUser(userData)\n  }, [userData, setUser])\n\n  return \u003cdiv\u003eWelcome, {user ? user.name : 'Guest'}!\u003c/div\u003e\n}\n\n// Usage:\n;\u003cAppProvider\u003e\n  \u003cUserComponent /\u003e\n\u003c/AppProvider\u003e\n```\n\n**Benefits of the combined approach**:\n\n- Avoids overloading context with complex state management.\n- Improves separation of concerns by delegating responsibilities: local state for UI, context for global app state, and React Query for async/server state.\n\n### Key takeaways\n\n- **Local state** for isolated, ephemeral data.\n- **Context API** for lightweight global state that rarely changes.\n- **Redux/Zustand** for structured, complex state management across large applications.\n- **React Query/SWR** for async data, caching, and server-side synchronization.\n- **Combined approach** for scalable, maintainable architecture.\n","title":"State management strategy in React","short_title":"State management strategy","description":"Discover state management strategies, best practices, and when to use each approach for scalable, efficient React applications","tags":["React"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh"],"date":"2024-10-29","filePath":"playground/frontend/react/state-management-strategy.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","react","state-management-strategy"]},{"content":"\nTesting is essential for ensuring that your code works as expected, is maintainable, and doesn't introduce bugs with future changes. React testing involves **unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (e2e) tests**, each targeting different aspects of your application's functionality.\n\nKey testing strategies for React applications:\n\n- **Unit testing** with Jest and React testing library\n- **Integration testing** for component interactions\n- **End-to-end (e2e) testing** with Cypress\n- **Snapshot testing** for UI consistency\n\n### Unit testing with Jest and React testing library\n\n**Unit testing** focuses on testing individual components or functions in isolation, ensuring they work as expected independently of other parts of the application. **Jest** is a popular testing framework for JavaScript that's fast and powerful, while **React testing library** provides utilities to interact with and assert on component output based on how a user would interact with it.\n\n#### Setting up Jest and React testing library\n\nInstall Jest and React testing library:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react\n```\n\nAdd a basic test configuration in your `package.json`:\n\n```js\n{ \"scripts\": { \"test\": \"jest\" } }\n```\n\n#### Example unit test for a button component\n\nSuppose we have a `Button` component that accepts a label and an onClick handler.\n\n```js\n// Button.js\nexport default function Button({ label, onClick }) {\n  return \u003cbutton onClick={onClick}\u003e{label}\u003c/button\u003e\n}\n```\n\n**Unit test for button component:**\n\n```jsx\n// Button.test.js\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Button from './Button'\n\ntest('renders the button with a label', () =\u003e {\n  render(\u003cButton label=\"Click me\" /\u003e)\n  expect(screen.getByText('Click me')).toBeInTheDocument()\n})\n\ntest('calls the onClick handler when clicked', () =\u003e {\n  const handleClick = jest.fn()\n  render(\u003cButton label=\"Click me\" onClick={handleClick} /\u003e)\n  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Click me'))\n  expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)\n})\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `screen.getByText(\"Click me\")` selects the button by its text, simulating how a user would identify it.\n- `fireEvent.click` simulates a click event, testing that `onClick` is called when expected.\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- **Isolation**: Tests each component individually, ensuring independent functionality.\n- **User-centric testing**: React testing library encourages testing from a user's perspective, improving test relevancy.\n\n### Integration testing for component interactions\n\nIntegration tests verify that multiple components work together as expected. For instance, testing a form component with multiple fields and a submit button ensures that they interact correctly and trigger the proper behaviors.\n\n#### Example: testing a form submission\n\nSuppose we have a form component with name and email fields and a submit button.\n\n```jsx\n// Form.js\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nexport default function Form({ onSubmit }) {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('')\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('')\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) =\u003e {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    onSubmit({ name, email })\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform onSubmit={handleSubmit}\u003e\n      \u003cinput placeholder=\"Name\" value={name} onChange={(e) =\u003e setName(e.target.value)} /\u003e\n      \u003cinput placeholder=\"Email\" value={email} onChange={(e) =\u003e setEmail(e.target.value)} /\u003e\n      \u003cbutton type=\"submit\"\u003eSubmit\u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Integration test for form component:**\n\n```jsx\n// Form.test.js\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Form from './Form'\n\ntest('submits form with name and email', () =\u003e {\n  const handleSubmit = jest.fn()\n  render(\u003cForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} /\u003e)\n\n  fireEvent.change(screen.getByPlaceholderText('Name'), { target: { value: 'John' } })\n  fireEvent.change(screen.getByPlaceholderText('Email'), { target: { value: 'john@example.com' } })\n  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Submit'))\n\n  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' })\n})\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- We simulate typing into both input fields, then trigger the form submission to ensure `onSubmit` is called with the correct data.\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- **Interaction testing**: Validates that components interact correctly, ensuring data flows as expected.\n- **Form and input testing**: Particularly useful for forms and multistep processes, verifying that all parts work in sequence.\n\n### End-to-end (e2e) testing with Cypress\n\nE2E tests simulate real user scenarios, covering the entire flow from start to finish, including interactions with the backend if needed. **Cypress** is a powerful tool for e2e testing in JavaScript applications, allowing for testing of full workflows across pages.\n\n#### Setting up Cypress\n\nInstall Cypress:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev cypress\n```\n\nOpen Cypress for the first time:\n\n```sh\nnpx cypress open\n```\n\n#### Example e2e test for a login flow\n\nSuppose we have a login form where users enter an email and password to authenticate.\n\n```jsx\n// cypress/integration/login.spec.js\ndescribe('Login Flow', () =\u003e {\n  it('logs in a user with valid credentials', () =\u003e {\n    cy.visit('/login')\n    cy.get('input[name=email]').type('john@example.com')\n    cy.get('input[name=password]').type('password123')\n    cy.get('button[type=submit]').click()\n\n    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard')\n    cy.contains('Welcome, John').should('be.visible')\n  })\n})\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **`cy.visit(\"/login\")`** navigates to the login page.\n- **Assertions** check that the login was successful by verifying the URL and checking for a welcome message.\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- **Real user simulation**: Tests full workflows, covering real user interactions with the application.\n- **Cross-page coverage**: Ensures that transitions between pages work as expected and user data is preserved.\n\n### Snapshot testing for UI consistency\n\nSnapshot tests capture the current state of a component's output (i.e., its rendered HTML) and compare it to a saved version. Snapshot testing is helpful for detecting unintended changes in the component's visual structure.\n\n#### Snapshot testing with Jest\n\n```jsx\n// Header.test.js\nimport { render } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Header from './Header'\n\ntest('renders the header correctly', () =\u003e {\n  const { asFragment } = render(\u003cHeader title=\"Hello, World!\" /\u003e)\n  expect(asFragment()).toMatchSnapshot()\n})\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `asFragment()` captures the component's current rendered state.\n- `toMatchSnapshot()` checks the current output against a previously saved snapshot.\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- **UI consistency**: Ensures that the UI remains visually consistent across updates.\n- **Quick regression detection**: Quickly identifies changes to the component's structure, ideal for components with complex styles or markup.\n\n**Limitations**:\n\n- Snapshots can be too sensitive to minor changes, so they are best used for components with stable layouts or infrequent updates.\n\n### Best practices for effective testing\n\n- **Follow the testing pyramid**: Focus primarily on unit tests, followed by integration tests, and finally e2e tests. This balances test coverage with performance and maintainability.\n- **Test from the user's perspective**: Use React testing library's queries like `getByText`, `getByRole`, and `getByLabelText` to mimic how users interact with your UI. Avoid testing internal implementation details, focusing on behavior instead.\n- **Avoid overuse of snapshot tests**: Snapshot tests are helpful but can become brittle if overused. Use them selectively for components with complex or static UI.\n- **Mock external dependencies**: For unit and integration tests, mock API calls, third-party libraries, and other dependencies to isolate the code under test. Libraries like **msw** (Mock Service Worker) can be used to mock API responses.\n- **Run tests in CI/CD**: Automate tests in your CI/CD pipeline to catch bugs early in the development process. Run unit and integration tests for each commit and e2e tests periodically or before release.\n- **Structure tests closely to source files**: Place each test file alongside its component or module. This structure makes it easy to locate and update tests when refactoring.\n\n### Summary\n\nIncorporating a comprehensive testing strategy helps ensure code quality, user experience, and long-term maintainability. Here's a quick summary:\n\n- **Unit testing**: Focus on individual components and functions with Jest and React testing library.\n- **Integration testing**: Test multiple components together, ensuring they work in harmony.\n- **End-to-end testing**: Use Cypress to cover full workflows and user journeys, verifying app behavior across pages.\n- **Snapshot testing**: Capture and compare UI structures, helpful for components with complex, static layouts.\n- **Best practices**: Adopt the testing pyramid, test from the user's perspective, mock dependencies, and automate tests in CI/CD\n","title":"Testing strategies in React","short_title":"Testing strategies","description":"React testing with unit, integration, and end-to-end approaches","tags":["react","testing"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh"],"date":"2024-10-29","filePath":"playground/frontend/react/testing-strategies.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","react","testing-strategies"]},{"content":"\nReact 18 was released in March 2022. This release focuses on performance improvements and updating the rendering engine.\n\n## React 18 Feature Quick Guide\n\nNow let's look at each of these updates in more detail.\n\n## Concurrency in React\n\n- Concurrency is not a feature, per se. It’s a new behind-the-scenes mechanism that enables React to prepare multiple versions of your UI at the same time.\n- A key property of Concurrent React is that rendering is interruptible. React may start rendering an update, pause in the middle, then continue later. It may even abandon an in-progress render altogether.\n- Another example is the reusable state. Concurrent React can remove sections of the UI from the screen, then add them back later while reusing the previous state.\n\n## New React 18 Features\n\n### Automatic Batching\n\n- Batching is when React groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance. For example, if you have two state updates inside of the same click event, React has always batched these into one re-render.\n\n```plain_text\nfunction App() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const [flag, setFlag] = useState(false);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(c =\u003e c + 1); // Does not re-render yet\n    setFlag(f =\u003e !f); // Does not re-render yet\n    // React will only re-render once at the end (that's batching!)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={handleClick}\u003eNext\u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003ch1 style={{ color: flag ? \"blue\" : \"black\" }}\u003e{count}\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n- However, React wasn’t consistent about when it batches updates. For example, if you need to fetch data, and then update the state in the `handleClick` above, then React would not batch the updates, and perform two independent updates.\n- Starting in React 18, all updates will be automatically batched, no matter where they originate from. This means that updates inside of timeouts, promises, native event handlers or any other event will batch the same way as updates inside of React events.\n\n```plain_text\nfunction handleClick() {\n  setCount(c =\u003e c + 1);\n  setFlag(f =\u003e !f);\n  // React will only re-render once at the end (that's batching!)\n}\n\nsetTimeout(() =\u003e {\n  setCount(c =\u003e c + 1);\n  setFlag(f =\u003e !f);\n  // React will only re-render once at the end (that's batching!)\n}, 1000);\n\nfetch(/*...*/).then(() =\u003e {\n  setCount(c =\u003e c + 1);\n  setFlag(f =\u003e !f);\n  // React will only re-render once at the end (that's batching!)\n})\n\n```\n\n### What if I don’t want to batch?\n\n- You can use `ReactDOM.flushSync()` to opt out of batching:\n\n```plain_text\nimport { flushSync } from 'react-dom'; // Note: react-dom, not react\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n  flushSync(() =\u003e {\n    setCounter(c =\u003e c + 1);\n  });\n  // React has updated the DOM by now\n  flushSync(() =\u003e {\n    setFlag(f =\u003e !f);\n  });\n  // React has updated the DOM by now\n}\n\n```\n\n## Transitions\n\n- Transitions allow you to mark updates as transitions, which tells React that they can be interrupted and avoid going back to Suspense fallbacks for already visible content.\n\n```plain_text\nimport {startTransition} from 'react';\n\n// Urgent: Show what was typed\nsetInputValue(input);\n\n// Mark any state updates inside as transitions\nstartTransition(() =\u003e {\n  // Transition: Show the results\n  setSearchQuery(input);\n});\n\n```\n\n- Updates wrapped in startTransition are handled as non-urgent and will be interrupted if more urgent updates like clicks or key presses come in. If a transition gets interrupted by the user (for example, by typing multiple characters in a row), React will throw out the stale rendering work that wasn’t finished and render only the latest update.\n- `useTransition`: a hook to start transitions, including a value to track the pending state.\n- `startTransition`: a method to start transitions when the hook cannot be used.\n\n## Suspense on the server\n\n- Server-side rendering (abbreviated to “SSR” in this post) lets you generate HTML from React components on the server, and send that HTML to your users. SSR lets your users see the page’s content before your JavaScript bundle loads and runs. SSR in React always happens in several steps:\n- On the server, fetch data for the entire app.\n- Then, on the server, render the entire app to HTML and send it in the response.\n- Then, on the client, load the JavaScript code for the entire app.\n- Then, on the client, connect the JavaScript logic to the server-generated HTML for the entire app (this is “hydration”).\n- The key part is that each step had to finish for the entire app at once before the next step could start. This is not efficient if some parts of your app are slower than others, as is the case in pretty much every non-trivial app.\n- React 18 lets you use `\u003cSuspense\u003e` to break down your app into smaller independent units which will go through these steps independently from each other and won’t block the rest of the app. As a result, your app’s users will see the content sooner and be able to start interacting with it much faster. The slowest part of your app won’t drag down the parts that are fast. These improvements are automatic, and you don’t need to write any special coordination code for them to work.\n\n## Strict mode\n\n- Strict Mode is a tool that helps identify coding patterns that may cause problems when working with React, like impure renders.\n- React 18 introduces a new development-only check to Strict Mode. This new check will automatically unmount and remount every component, whenever a component mounts for the first time, restoring the previous state on the second mount.\n- Before this change, React would mount the component and create the effects:\n\n```plain_text\n\n* React mounts the component.\n  * Layout effects are created.\n  * Effects are created.\n\n```\n\n- With Strict Mode in React 18, React will simulate unmounting and remounting the component in development mode:\n\n```plain_text\n\n* React mounts the component.\n  * Layout effects are created.\n  * Effects are created.\n* React simulates unmounting the component.\n  * Layout effects are destroyed.\n  * Effects are destroyed.\n* React simulates mounting the component with the previous state.\n  * Layout effects are created.\n  * Effects are created.\n\n```\n\n## How to upgrade to React 18\n\n- React 18 introduces a new root API which provides better ergonomics for managing roots. The new root API also enables the new concurrent renderer, which allows you to opt-into concurrent features.\n\n```plain_text\n// Before\nimport { render } from 'react-dom';\nconst container = document.getElementById('app');\nrender(\u003cApp tab=\"home\" /\u003e, container);\n\n// After\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nconst container = document.getElementById('app');\nconst root = createRoot(container); // createRoot(container!) if you use TypeScript\nroot.render(\u003cApp tab=\"home\" /\u003e);\n\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- In a summary, React 18 comes with a few breaking changes, depending on how you use it. But all in all, it also brings out-of-the-box performance improvements including batching more by default, which removes the need to manually batch updates in application or library code.\n- Upgrading to React 18 should be straightforward, give it a try and let us know what you think.\n","title":"React 18","short_title":"","description":"React 18 was released in March 2022.

By breaking down the page into smaller components, it becomes evident that many components are non-interactive and can be rendered on the server as Server Components. This can improve performance, reduce bundle size and also improve the initial page loading time.\n\n### What are React Server Components?\n\n- React Server Components are server-side components that facilitate seamless collaboration between server and Client Components (”use client”) for rendering React applications. RSCs are stateless components designed to run on the server, enhancing the transition between server-rendered content and client-side interactivity.\n- RSCs also allow data fetching to be part of the component tree, using top-level await and server-side data serialization.\n- RSCs prioritize server-side rendering and generate static content on the server.\n- They use a protocol that lets the client request parts of the component tree from the server, enabling a hybrid of Single-Page Application (SPA) and Multi-Page Application (MPA) architectures.\n- They depend on frameworks to implement them, and the React team expects them to become widely used and change the ecosystem.\n- They also support async/await for data fetching and plan to add a “use()” hook for client-side data loading.\n\n### Why Server Components?\n\nServer Components make your app load faster and use less JavaScript. The base runtime is fixed and cacheable, and more JavaScript is only added when you need client-side interactivity with Client Components.\n\nNext.js renders the initial HTML on the server and sends it to the browser. The browser then enhances the HTML with interactivity by loading the Next.js and React runtime asynchronously. This lets the client take over the app and handle user interactions.\n\n## How to use Server Components in Next.js?\n\nIn the latest release of Next.js, they have introduced Server Components as essential requirements to be utilized in the construction of their single-page applications (SPAs).\n\nTo enhance code maintainability and readability, it is recommended to use the file naming convention of **`.server.(jsx|tsx)`** for Server components, and **`.client.(jsx|tsx)`** for Client components.\n\nIn Client components use the `use client` directive at the top of any file that contains client-side components or logic. This will mark the boundary between server-only and client.\n\n![](assets/react-server-component_server-components-1.webp)\n\nHere is an example of a simple RSC that fetches some data from a database and renders it on the server:\n\n```jsx\n// app/Greeting.server.js\nimport db from './db'\n\nexport default function Greeting({ name }) {\n  // Fetch data from the database on the server\n  const message = db.getGreeting(name)\n\n  // Return a plain object with the data\n  return { message }\n}\n```\n\nAnd here is how you can use it in your client-side component:\n\n```jsx\n// app/Homepage.client.js\n'use client' // Mark this file as client-only\nimport Greeting from './Greeting.server' // Import the RSC\n\nexport default function Homepage() {\n  // Use the RSC as a regular component\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003eWelcome to Next.js!\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cGreeting name=\"Alice\" /\u003e // Render the RSC\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n![](assets/react-server-component_server-components-2.webp)\n\n`use client` marks the transition from server-only to client code. It goes at the top of a file, before any imports, to indicate that everything below it belongs to the client bundle. This includes any modules or components that are imported in the file.\n\nServer Components are incompatible with custom hooks that use state, effects, or browser-only APIs.\n\n## What are the benefits of using Server Components with Next.js?\n\nUsing RSC with Next.js can bring several benefits to your application, such as:\n\n- Improved performance: reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the server and the client, as well as the amount of code that needs to be parsed and executed on the client. This can result in faster page loads and better user experience.\n- Reduced bundle size: this allows you to move large dependencies or logic that are only needed on the server to RSC files, which are not included in the client bundle. This can reduce the size of your client-side code and improve performance and caching.\n- Simplified data fetching: eliminate the need for using APIs or fetching data on the client for some parts of your application via access directly to backend resources. This can simplify your code, reduce dependencies complexity, errors and keep sensitive information on the backend.\n\n### Pattern for using Server Components\n\n- To optimize our component tree, we aim to relocate client components to the leaf nodes whenever feasible. Rather than designating the entire component as a client component, we extract the interactive logic and place it in a client-specific component, such as `\u003cSearchBar /\u003e, \u003cInput /\u003e...` and so on. Meanwhile, we maintain static components like `\u003cLayout /\u003e, \u003cList /\u003e...` as server components. This approach eliminates the need to transmit the entire JavaScript code for the layout to the client.\n- Server and Client Components can be combined in the same component tree, which means:\n  - On the server, React renders **all** Server Components **before** sending the result to the client.\n  - On the client, React renders Client Components and *slots in* the rendered result of Server Components, merging the work done on the server and client.\n- Importing Server Components in Client Components is **not supported**, so Server Components will treat as **Client Components.**\n\n```jsx\n'use client';\n\n\u003cClientComponents\u003e\n  \u003cServerComponents\u003e\n\u003c/ClientComponents\u003e\n```\n\n- We suggest passing Server Components as `children` props to Client Components and importing and nesting `\u003cClientComponent\u003e` in a parent component. We can use this way for both libraries and context that only work on the client or was not added `use client` in their files.\n\n```jsx\n\u003cClientComponents\u003e{children} // The children is Server Components\u003c/ClientComponents\u003e\n```\n\n- Both Server and Client Components can share JavaScript modules, but this can cause security issues if some code with sensitive data that should only run on the server gets exposed to the client. To avoid this, we can use packages like `server-only` that keep the server-only code separate from the client code. We can use this package by importing `server-only` in any modules like this:\n\n```jsx\nimport 'server-only'\n\nexport async function getData() {\n  // Do get the data\n}\n```\n\n### Server Components Data Fetching in Next.js\n\nWith the new features implemented to the `fetch` WebAPI and make the use of `async/await` in Server Components, now the `fetch` can provide us a higher performance on caching/revalidating fetched data and prevent memory caching duplicate requests.\n\nNext.js caches the data from fetch requests by default. When Next.js renders a page on the server and comes across a fetch, it will look for the data in the cache first. If the data is there, it will use it. If not, it will fetch and store the data for later requests. Or we can use native `cache` function of react to manually cache the data if unable to use `fetch` WebAPI.\n\nFor revalidating the cache data, that the `fetch` API introduced two ways are:\n\n- [Background revalidate](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/revalidating#background-revalidation) at a specific time interval\n- On-Demand revalidate by using [revalidatePath](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath) (for app route) or [revalidateTag](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag) (the tag of the `fetch` request)\n\nWe can use the [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions) in handling actions in Client Components interactive actions by adding `use server` in the handling action:\n\n```jsx\nexport default function Form() {\n  async function handleSubmit() {\n    'use server'\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  async function submitPicture() {\n    'use server'\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform action={handleSubmit}\u003e\n      \u003cinput type=\"text\" name=\"name\" /\u003e\n      \u003cinput type=\"image\" formAction={submitImage} /\u003e\n      \u003cbutton type=\"submit\"\u003eSubmit\u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIf we don’t use `fetch` to cache the API on server code, we can still fetch data on the client side. We suggest using libraries like `SWR` or `React Query` with Client Components. Later, we’ll also be able to use React’s [use()](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching#use-in-client-components) hook to fetch data in Client Components.\n\nIf we planning to use `react-query` on the project, we can use the approach with [initialData](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/ssr#using-initialdata-2) in `useQuery` or [Hydrate](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/ssr#using-hydrate) .\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, React Server Components (RSCs) provide a powerful way to render React applications by enabling collaboration between server and client components. They improve performance, reduce bundle size, and enhance initial page loading time. By breaking down the page into smaller components, non-interactive parts can be rendered on the server as Server Components, resulting in faster page loads and better user experience. RSCs in Next.js offer benefits such as improved performance, reduced bundle size, and simplified data fetching. Overall, RSCs offer developers a more efficient and seamless rendering experience for React applications.\n\n## References\n\n- [SSR | TanStack Query Docs](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/ssr#using-hydrate)\n- [Getting Started | Next.js (nextjs.org)](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials)\n- [Introducing Zero-Bundle-Size React Server Components – React](https://react.dev/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components)\n","title":"React Server Components, NextJs Route and Data Fetching","short_title":"","description":"React Server Components (RSCs) offer the flexibility to decide where to render components based on their purpose, diverging from the client-side rendering approach of Single-Page Applications.","tags":["frontend","react","nextjs","server-component","caching-data"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["chinhld12"],"date":"Sun May 28 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/react-server-component.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","react-server-component"]},{"content":"\nA brief comparison between Remix and Next.js frameworks\n\n## Introduction of Remix\nRemix describes itself as:\n\n\u003e Remix is an edge native, full-stack JavaScript framework for building modern, fast, and resilient user experiences. It unifies the client and server with web standards so you can think less about code and more about your product.\n\nCompared to Next.js, which is one of the most React frameworks used for server-side rendering and has been there for a significant time, Remix appears as a new strong competitor. Developers have started to wonder what the difference between these two frameworks is. \n\nIn this post, we will mainly focus on Remix and highlight what makes it unique and where it shines the most.\n\n## How is Remix different from Next.js?\n### Page rendering strategies\nDespite the same idea of creating websites that are rendered on the server before being sent to the client, Remix and Next.js go with distinct approaches.\n\nRemix doesn't support Static Site Generation (SSG) but it suggests using HTTP stale-while-revalidate caching directive (SWR) as an alternative. The key here is that static routes are cached using a CDN. These routes are then served to users on each visit and automatically revalidated for the next visitor.\n\n### Routing\nBoth Remix and Next.js follow a file-based routing system.\n\nIn Next.js, each file inside the `/pages` directory will be automatically set as a route. \n\n```javascript\npages/index.js ==\u003e /\npages/users/index.js ==\u003e /users\npages/users/create.js ==\u003e /users/create\n```\n\nRemix also does the same but the route directory is `/app/routes`:\n\n```javascript\napp/routes/index.js ==\u003e /\napp/routes/users/index.js ==\u003e /users\napp/routes/users/create.js ==\u003e /users/create\n```\n\nBuilt on top of React Router, Remix shines when it comes to nested routing. It comes with a very powerful route nesting mechanism that can put one or many routes inside another route and those act like children components that can be mounted and unmounted depending on the active URL path. We need to use an Outlet component to render the route hierarchy from the parent routes.\n\nNext.js, on the other hand, comes with its own router and has support for routes nesting but it’s not so easy to do so compared to Remix.\n\n### Data Loading\nNext.js supports different ways for loading data on the server-side like `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` based on the type of web app.\n\nRemix has a new concept with two portions:\n\n* `loader` function - used to load data in a component, and a supplementary\n* `useLoaderData hook` - used to get access to the data returned by the `loader` function\n\n```javascript\nimport { useLoaderData } from \"remix\";\n\nexport const loader = () =\u003e {\n  // fetch data from database or make API calls\n  return {data}\n};\n\nexport default function App() {\n // get access to data\n  let {data} = useLoaderData();\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eUse Data in component {data}\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Data Mutation\nNext.js doesn't do anything for mutations. Basically, we would have to handle everything from creating a form, fetching data, managing state, adding event handlers, to finally dealing with errors, interruptions, and race conditions.\n\nData mutations in Remix are built on top of two fundamental web APIs: `\u003cform\u003e` and HTTP. All we have to do is to use a `\u003cForm\u003e` component (works identically to `\u003cform\u003e` with a couple of extra goodies for optimistic UI etc.) and a route function named `action`. When the user submits a form, Remix with call the action for the form and reload all of the data on the page. This ensures that any updates to the data are reflected in the UI.\n\n```javascript\nexport const action = async ({ request }) =\u003e {\n  const form = await request.formData()\n  const content = form.get('content')\n  return redirect('/')\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cForm method=\"POST\"\u003e\n        \u003clabel htmlFor=\"content\"\u003e\n          Content: \u003ctextarea name=\"content\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/label\u003e\n        \u003cinput type=\"submit\" value=\"Add New\" /\u003e\n      \u003c/Form\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Error Handling\nNext.js define some custom pages for certain status errors like 404 or 500 errors. However, some errors around data and rendering are not supported.\n\nRemix has an error boundary for handling errors. When we create a route component, we can also define an error boundary for catching any errors that occur in the route component. It likes having two components in a route file, with one being the actual route component and one being the fallback when errors happen in the former. One noteworthy thing is when there is an error in a nested component route and this route has no error boundary, the error bubbles up the nested tree until caught by a parent’s error boundary.\n\n![](assets/remix-versus-nextjs_a7d49c4d71418c892f72a5c2a7dbee19_md5.webp)\n\n## Conclusion\nFor React developers, Next.js is obviously the prior choice when it comes to server-side rendering for its familiar concepts and larger community. Has been around for a while, it seems like a steady pedestal and is not easy to be replaced in a short period.\n\nEven so, Remix looks like a shiny new thing. It also provides a higher level of abstraction. Routing system might be confusing but it is a remarkable feature too. Other built-in features such as data loading, data mutations, error boundary, etc. actually improve the developer experience.\n\nOverall, Remix is a new framework, and it will definitely become more powerful and widespread in the future.\n","title":"Remix Versus Nextjs","short_title":"","description":"A brief comparison between Remix and Next.js frameworks","tags":["engineering","frontend","radio"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["khacvy"],"date":"Fri May 27 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/remix-versus-nextjs.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","remix-versus-nextjs"]},{"content":"\n![](assets/remove-unused-css-styles-from-bootstrap-using-purgecss_50067f1125ee42d2d68068bd93443235_md5.webp)\n\n## Introduction\n\nReducing assets size is one of the most practical ways to speed up your web application. I have a simple use case, lets imagine your HTML file looks like this\n\n```javascript\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n\u003chead\u003e\n  \u003cmeta charset=\"UTF-8\"\u003e\n  \u003cmeta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"\u003e\n  \u003cmeta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\"\u003e\n  \u003ctitle\u003eBootstrap\u003c/title\u003e\n\n  \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./bootstrap-grid.min.css\" /\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"row\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"col-sm-4\"\u003e.col-sm-4\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"col-sm-4\"\u003e.col-sm-4\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"col-sm-4\"\u003e.col-sm-4\u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nNow look at\n\n```javascript\nbootstrap - grid.min.css\n```\n\n![](assets/remove-unused-css-styles-from-bootstrap-using-purgecss_50067f1125ee42d2d68068bd93443235_md5.webp)\n\nQuite huge isn’t it? Thanks to PurgeCss here is the CSS file after being purged will only contain parts of the CSS file (only used selectors), as you can see horizontal scrollbar is not very long:\n\n## Usage\n\nPurgeCSS can be installed with npm package\n\n```javascript\nnpm i --save-dev purgecss\n```\n\nBasically, you run it against your CSS files and your HTML/JavaScript files. It will parse and analyze which CSS content will be used and remove unused CSS content.\n\nPurgeCSS can be used as a CLI. This is our project structure, we gonna need to transform CSS files so we have to download bootstrap distro and get file we want to transform.\n\n![](assets/remove-unused-css-styles-from-bootstrap-using-purgecss_a903c03602f38038a2c4e4eb4344e0b9_md5.webp)\n\nCLI command syntax\n\n`purgecss --css \u003ccss file\u003e --content \u003ccontent file to parse css\u003e --out \u003coutput-directory\u003e`\n\nSince Purgecss is installed in `/node_modules\\` we must run this command through npm script. We use `--out dist` option to store output CSS files in dist folder after transformed. Now change the path of `bootstrap-grid.min.css` in `index.html` to:\n\n`\u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./dist/bootstrap-grid.min.css\" /\u003e`\n\nThen create npm script to run purgecss\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"name\": \"PurgeCSS\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"license\": \"MIT\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"webpack\": \"^4.29.0\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"purgecss --css bootstrap-grid.min.css --content index.html --out dist/\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen run npm run build, you should see new bootstrap-grid.min.css in dist folder with unused CSS content being removed\n\n![](assets/remove-unused-css-styles-from-bootstrap-using-purgecss_04ee21f4b60188ce76c21df96695e6cf_md5.webp)\n\n![](assets/remove-unused-css-styles-from-bootstrap-using-purgecss_dd640e027b4421ee74d88c2864f0c9ed_md5.webp)\n\nYou can view full CLI options at [https://www.purgecss.com/cli\\](https://www.purgecss.com/cli%5C)\n\nExample repository: [https://github.com/PhmNgocNghia/purge\\-css\\-demo\\-cli\\](https://github.com/PhmNgocNghia/purge%5C-css%5C-demo%5C-cli%5C)\n\n## Setup using Webpack\n\nPurge CSS can be used together with built tools such as webpack, gulp, grunt,… etc. You can view it’s documentation at [https://www.purgecss.com/\\](https://www.purgecss.com/%5C)\n\nI’m going to demonstrate how to integrate with Webpack.

All unused selectors has been removed. You can view the documentation at [https://www.purgecss.com/\\](https://www.purgecss.com/%5C) which contain details instruction and api references.\n\nNot only bootstrap, you can use PurgeCSS with many css libraries such as TailwindCSS, Zurb foundation,... etc.\n","title":"Remove Unused CSS Styles From Bootstrap Using Purgecss","short_title":"","description":"This article demonstrates how to use PurgeCSS to remove unused CSS styles from Bootstrap.","tags":["css","frontend"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["nghiaphm"],"date":"Fri Feb 01 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/remove-unused-css-styles-from-bootstrap-using-purgecss.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","remove-unused-css-styles-from-bootstrap-using-purgecss"]},{"content":"\nData-fetching libraries are software tools or frameworks that can help improve the performance and scalability of your application by handling network requests and data processing more efficiently. In React, one of the key challenges these libraries address is optimizing rendering to avoid unnecessary re-rendering of components when the underlying data remains unchanged. This helps to prevent situations where components re-render multiple times despite no changes in the data, resulting in improved efficiency and smoother user experiences.\n\nLet's dive in how it works.\n\n## Deduplication\n\nData-fetching libraries typically use caching strategies to reduce the number of network requests that need to be made, and improve the performance of the application. By using a unique key as the identifier and stale-while-revalidate as cache validation, the library will return responses from cached data or make a network request.\n\n![](assets/render-optimization-in-data-fetching-libraries_render-optimization-in-data-fetching-1.webp)\n\n## Data selection\n\nEverytime a request is sent, the corresponding components will be updated by 3 very common stateful values:\n\n```json\n{ data, error, fetching }\n```\n\nLook at `fetching`, this flag is quite useful if you want to display a loading indicator. But it's also kinda unnecessary if you don't do that. Then your component will render twice even though nothing changed in data because this flag is always true when a request is in-flight and otherwise. Unexpected render happens when a hook request is used like:\n\n```js\nconst data = useRequest(...)\n```\n\nFor this use-case, most libraries is designed to notify on what properties are using in component only. So it's recommended to use destructuring instead:\n\n```js\nconst { data, error } = useRequest(...)\n```\n\n## Structural sharing\n\nStructural sharing is the most advance feature that can optimize rendering over data selection. One of the data-fetching libraries has turned on out of the box is [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/). To use this feature, makes sure your data is kept referential identity on every level. As an example, suppose we have the following data structure:\n\n```json\n[\n  { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Learn React\", \"status\": \"active\" },\n  { \"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Learn React Query\", \"status\": \"todo\" }\n]\n```\n\nNow suppose first todo is changed into the *done* state:\n\n```diff\n[\n- { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Learn React\", \"status\": \"active\" },\n+ { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Learn React\", \"status\": \"done\" },\n { \"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Learn React Query\", \"status\": \"todo\" }\n]\n```\n\nStructural sharing will attempt to compare the old state and the new and keep as much of the previous state as possible.\n\nThis comes in very handy when using selectors for partial subscriptions:\n\n```js\n// ✅ will only re-render if _something_ within todo with id:2 changes\n// thanks to structural sharing\nconst { data } = useTodo(2)\n```\n\nIn some instances, especially when having very large datasets, structural sharing *can* be a bottleneck. Let's use it carefully.\n\n## References\n\n- https://tkdodo.eu/blog/react-query-render-optimizations\n- https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching\n- https://swr.vercel.app/docs/advanced/performance\n- https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/caching\n","title":"Render optimization in data-fetching libraries","short_title":"","description":"Data-fetching libraries are software tools or frameworks that can help improve the performance and scalability of your application by handling network requests and data processing more efficiently.","tags":["engineering","frontend","data-fetching"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["cor3.co"],"date":"Thu Jun 08 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/render-optimization-in-data-fetching-libraries.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","render-optimization-in-data-fetching-libraries"]},{"content":"\nA comprehensive August 2024 update on key advancements in React 19, Next.js 15, and web development tools.

The core object is often created externally and connected via Context API. Libraries use the Observer pattern to notify React of changes, triggering re-renders with useSyncExternalStore or custom hooks\n\n### [Time to ditch Redux: Why most React apps don't need it](https://www.bennett.ink/its-probably-time-to-stop-recommending-redux)\n\nRedux might be holding your app back! Most **state** is actually API data better handled with caching tools. Modern React can handle complex UI state with useState and custom hooks - no global store needed. Skip the boilerplate and complexity; your team will thank you when they don't have to trace actions through multiple files anymore.\n\n### [Use React 19's cache() to kill waterfall fetching](https://aurorascharff.no/posts/avoiding-server-component-waterfall-fetching-with-react-19-cache/)\n\nReact 19's cache() API for Server Components caches data fetches/computations per render, preventing redundant requests. This reduces data coupling between components and enables data preloading to avoid waterfall fetching, improving performance. Use cache() for custom data fetching functions (like database calls), as the built-in fetch() API in Next.js already handles caching\n\n### Quick links\n\n- [Beyond React.memo: Smart performance optimization that actually works](https://cekrem.github.io/posts/beyond-react-memo-smarter-performance-optimization/)\n- [The URL: React's underrated state manager](https://iamsahaj.xyz/blog/react-state-in-the-url/)\n- [React: The unexpected perfect engine for LLM workflows](https://www.gensx.com/blog/why-react-is-the-best-backend-workflow-engine)\n- [Server Actions with Toast: React's useActionState explained](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-server-actions-useactionstate-toast/)\n\n## Next.js\n\n### [Next.js middleware exploit: CVE-2025-29927 authorization bypass](https://zeropath.com/blog/nextjs-middleware-cve-2025-29927-auth-bypass)\n\nCritical CVE-2025-29927 in Next.js middleware lets attackers bypass security via the x-middleware-subrequest header.

The CSS preprocessor era might finally be ending!\n\n### [Why prefetching can actually slow your site down](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/prefetch-slower-website)\n\nWhile prefetching is supposed to improve website performance by loading resources in advance, it can sometimes worsen loading speed by competing with critical content for bandwidth. Despite being assigned the lowest priority, prefetch requests may initiate too early, delaying the loading of important elements like the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). To prevent this, you can inject prefetch hints via JavaScript after the initial page load to make sure essential content loads first.\n\n### Quick links\n\n- [CSS individual transforms are additive (and awesome)](https://polypane.app/blog/the-css-transform-property-and-individual-transforms-are-additive)\n- [CSS relative colors: Dynamic color generation is here](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-relative-colors/)\n- [TypeScript: The JavaScript sidekick you didn't know you needed!](https://2ality.com/2025/03/typescript-sales-pitch.html)\n\n## Trending\n\n### [React 2025: Server power unleashed \u0026 dev tools evolved!](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-trends/)\n\nThis year, expect **React Server Components (RSC)** to become standard. **React Server Functions (RSF)** will simplify data fetching \u0026 mutations. **React 19** brings form improvements.

However, it can also present some painful challenges for accessibility and usability. One of the most common issues happens when you are scrolling the list, then click on an item to view its detail (and of course, is navigated to another page). When going back to the list, you lose your previous scroll position and have to scroll all the way to find the item you clicked on before.\n\n![](assets/retain-scroll-position-in-infinite-scroll_infinite_scrolling.webp)\n\n_Image Source: [https://www.explainxkcd.com](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1309:_Infinite_Scrolling)_\n\n## Solution\n\nIn this article, we will show you an approach using the session storage to store the scroll position, with the infinite scroll implemented using [`useSWRInfinite`](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/pagination.en-US#useswrinfinite).\n\n```javascript\nexport const LIST_STATES_KEY = 'infinite-scroll-list-states'\n\nexport default function createRetainPositionStore\u003c\n\tT extends SWRInfiniteResponse\u003cany, any\u003e,\n\u003e(storeKey = LIST_STATES_KEY) {\n\tfunction useRetainPosition({ swr }: { swr: T }) {\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n\n\tfunction handleSaveStates({ swr }: { swr: T }) {\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n\n\treturn { useRetainPosition, handleSaveStates }\n}\n```\n\nLet's begin by creating a `createRetainPositionStore` that takes in a key that we will use to store and retrieve data from the session storage.\n\nWe will also implement two functions inside, one to handle the behaviors before routing happens, and another one for those when we go back to the page and want to retain the scroll position. Both of them accept the parameter of `swr` which is the [response](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/pagination.en-US#return-values) of the `useSWRInfinite()`.\n\n```javascript\nfunction handleSaveStates({ swr }: { swr: T }) {\n  sessionStorage.setItem(storeKey, JSON.stringify({ swrSize: swr.size, scrollPosition: window.scrollY }))\n}\n```\n\nThe function above simply stores an object with `swrSize` and `scrollPosition` to the session storage. When a user clicks on an item and is navigated to the detail page, we call this function along with the routing function to store the vertical scroll position (`scrollPosition`) and also the number of pages (or a group of several consecutive items) that infinite scroll already loaded (`swrSize`).\n\n```javascript\nfunction useRetainPosition({ swr }: { swr: T }) {\n  const documentHeight = document?.documentElement.scrollHeight || 0\n  const listStates = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem(storeKey) || '{}')\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    if (typeof listStates.scrollPosition !== 'number') {\n      return undefined\n    }\n\n    if (documentHeight \u003e listStates.scrollPosition) {\n      window.scrollTo(0, listStates.scrollPosition)\n      sessionStorage.removeItem(storeKey)\n    }\n  }, [documentHeight, listStates.scrollPosition])\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    if (typeof listStates.swrSize !== 'number') {\n      return undefined\n    }\n\n    if (listStates.swrSize \u003e 1) {\n      swr.setSize(listStates.swrSize)\n    }\n  }, [listStates.swrSize, swr])\n}\n```\n\nThe hook `useRetainPosition` is called in the listing page that uses the infinite scroll technique, so that everytime we visit the page, the two `useEffect`s help us to retrieve the data from the session storage. The `scrollPosition` is used for scrolling the page to the previous position. The `swrSize`, on the other hand, is passed to the `setSize` function to tell `swr` how many pages already loaded before we were navigated to the item detail page.\n\nThis makes sense since as mentioned above, when user clicks on an item and is navigated to the detail page, we will store those data to the session storage, and when user wants to go back to the listing page, `useRetainPosition` can retrieve those data and the page will be scrolled to the previous position. After calling `window.scrollTo(0, listStates.scrollPosition)`, don't forget to remove the relating data from the session storage to prevent unwanted scrolling behaviors of the page in the future.\n\n## Reference\n\n- https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1309:_Infinite_Scrolling\n","title":"Retain scroll position in infinite scroll","short_title":"","description":"Infinite scroll has become a popular web design technique in recent years, as it offers several benefits over traditional pagination models.

They are animations that are connected to the scroll position of a scroll container. So, as you scroll up or down, the animation moves accordingly. For example, think of background images that move with your scroll or indicators that show your progress as you read through a page. Another type of scroll-driven animation is linked to an element's position within its scroll container. With this, elements can smoothly fade in as they become visible.\n\nIn the past, achieving these effects involved responding to scroll events on the main thread. However, this made it difficult to create smooth and synchronized animations. But now, thanks to the Scroll-driven Animations specification, you have access to new APIs and concepts that enable you to easily create declarative scroll-driven animations. These APIs work seamlessly with the Web Animations API and CSS Animations API.\n\n## Animation timelines\n\nBy default, an animation attached to an element runs on the document timeline. Its origin time starts at 0 when the page loads, and starts ticking forwards as clock time progresses. This is the default animation timeline and, until now, was the only animation timeline you had access to.\n\nThe Scroll-driven Animations Specification defines two new types of timelines that you can use:\n\n### Scroll Progress Timeline\n\nA **Scroll Progress Timeline** is an animation timeline that is linked to progress in the scroll position of a scroll container–also called scrollport or scroller–along a particular axis. It converts a position in a scroll range into a percentage of progress.\n\nThe starting scroll position represents 0% progress and the ending scroll position represents 100% progress. In the following visualization, you can see that the progress counts up from 0% to 100% as you scroll the scroller from top to bottom.\n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-uploads/video/AeNB0cHNDkYPUYzDuv8gInYA9rY2/xdU4YJ6cxjNYpec1XcE6.mp4\" controls\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\n\nVisualization of a Scroll Progress Timeline. As you scroll down to the bottom of the scroller, the progress value counts up from 0% to 100%. Source: https://developer.chrome.com/articles/scroll-driven-animations/\n\n### View Progress Timeline\n\nA **View Progress Timeline** is an animation timeline that is linked to the relative progress of a particular element within a scroll container.\n\nJust like **IntersectionObserver**, this feature tracks how much of an element is visible in the scroller. If the element is completely hidden, it's not considered intersecting. But even if a small part of the element is visible, it's considered intersecting.\n\nA View Progress Timeline starts when the subject enters the scroll container and ends when it leaves. In the visualization, the progress begins at 0% when the subject enters and reaches 100% when it exits the container.\n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-uploads/video/AeNB0cHNDkYPUYzDuv8gInYA9rY2/rvPTFW2277KBTuWiZFj1.mp4\" controls\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\n\nVisualization of a View Progress Timeline. The progress counts up from 0% to 100% as the subject (green box) crosses the scroller. Source: https://developer.chrome.com/articles/scroll-driven-animations/\n\n## Basic usage\n\nTo demonstrate the Scroll-driven Animations, we will re-create the animation from [this demo](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/mdVWgdN) without using any JavaScript. Let's grab some code from the original example:\n\n```\n\u003cbody\u003e\n  \u003csvg width=\"100\" height=\"100\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M21,9H15V22H13V16H11V22H9V9H3V7H21M12,2A2,2 0 0,1 14,4A2,2 0 0,1 12,6C10.89,6 10,5.1 10,4C10,2.89 10.89,2 12,2Z\" /\u003e\n\u003c/svg\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n```\n\n```\nsvg {\n  position: fixed;\n  top: 50%;\n  left: 50%;\n  margin-top: -50px;\n  margin-left: -50px;\n}\n\n@keyframes rotate {\n  to {\n    transform: rotate(360deg);\n  }\n}\n\nbody {\n  min-height: 500vh;\n}\n```\n\nOur goal is to make the icon rotate based on the user's scrolling. To achieve this, we need to create a Scroll Progress Timeline using CSS. The simplest way to do this is by using the `scroll()` function. It allows us to create an anonymous Scroll Timeline, which we can then set as the value for the new `animation-timeline` property.\n\n```\nsvg {\n  ...\n  animation: rotate auto linear;\n  animation-timeline: scroll(root, block);\n}\n```\n\nThe `scroll()` function requires two arguments: `\u003cscroller\u003e` and `\u003caxis\u003e`. Here are the accepted values for each argument:\n\nFor the `\u003cscroller\u003e` argument:\n\n**nearest**: Uses the nearest ancestor scroll container (default). **root**: Uses the document viewport as the scroll container. **self**: Uses the element itself as the scroll container.\n\nFor the `\u003caxis\u003e` argument:\n\n**block**: Measures the progress along the block axis of the scroll container (default). **inline**: Measures the progress along the inline axis of the scroll container. **y**: Measures the progress along the y-axis of the scroll container. **x**: Measures the progress along the x-axis of the scroll container.\n\nIn our case, to bind an animation to the root scroller on the block axis, you can use the simplified syntax `scroll(root block)`. Also, note that when using a Scroll Progress Timeline, it does not make sense to set the `animation-duration` in seconds. Instead, you should set it to `auto`.\n\nYou can find the full code of this example at this [link](https://codepen.io/Levi-ackerman/pen/BaqeENy)\n\nNote: Make sure you run this example in Chrome 115 or above with the 'Experimental Web Platform Features' enabled.\n\nThat's it! With just a few lines of CSS code, we've created an awesome scroll animation. You can create many amazing animations with Scroll-driven Animation.

Functioning as an AI assistant, Javis is designed to facilitate a smooth and enriching web browsing experience for users. During its testing phase in Chrome, I faced a unique challenge - **Javis's CSS clashed with the webpage's CSS**. The result was a distortion of both the application's and the webpage's interfaces. Following a research, I unearthed a potent solution - the Shadow DOM. In this piece, I aim to explain the concept of Shadow DOM and shed light on the its advantage of encapsulating style.\n\n## What is Shadow DOM?\n\nShadow DOM is a web standard that allows encapsulation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within a specific context. Shadow DOM allows hidden DOM trees to be attached to elements in the regular DOM tree — this shadow DOM tree starts with a shadow root, underneath which you can attach any element, in the same way as the normal DOM.\n\n![](assets/shadow-dom.svg) Source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM\n\nThere are some bits of shadow DOM terminology to be aware of:\n\n- **Shadow host**: The regular DOM node that the shadow DOM is attached to.\n- **Shadow tree**: The DOM tree inside the shadow DOM.\n- **Shadow boundary**: the place where the shadow DOM ends, and the regular DOM begins.\n- **Shadow root**: The root node of the shadow tree.\n\nWhen working with the shadow DOM, you have the power to manipulate its nodes just like you would with non-shadow nodes. This includes appending children, setting attributes, and applying styles using `element.style.color` or a `\u003cstyle\u003e` element within the shadow DOM. The key distinction is that any code within the shadow DOM remains encapsulated, unable to affect elements outside of it, providing a valuable encapsulation feature.\n\n## Basic usage\n\nNow that we understand the importance of Shadow DOM, let's explore how to create and manipulate Shadow DOM. You can create Shadow Dom by attaching a shadow root to any element using the `Element.attachShadow()` method. This takes as its parameter an options object that contains one option — `mode` — with a value of `open` or `closed`:\n\n```js\nconst shadowOpen = host.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })\nconst shadowClosed = host.attachShadow({ mode: 'closed' })\n```\n\n- `open`: The shadow DOM/ internal DOM of the component is accessible from outside JavaScript.\n- `closed`: The shadow DOM/ internal DOM of the component is not accessible outside JavaScript. The `\u003cvideo\u003e` tag is an example of closed-mode shadow root.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nShadow DOM provides a powerful tool for developers creating website extensions, widgets, and similar interactive components. It offers the benefit of encapsulation, ensuring styles and scripts do not clash with the host page, that can significantly enhance the reliability and user experience of your applications.\n\n## References\n\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM\n","title":"Shadow DOM","short_title":"","description":"Shadow DOM is a web standard that allows encapsulation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within a specific context.","tags":["frontend","shadow-dom","dom","web-api"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["khacvy"],"date":"Tue May 16 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/shadow-dom.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","shadow-dom"]},{"content":"\n## Overview\n\nFor global state management in some frameworks like ReactJs; we already have Redux, React Context, Recoil, and Mobx... for handling that. But if we only need the vanilla javascript for handling specific state and avoid using the library to manage the state (like minimizing the bundle-size, avoid on creating too many instances...), we can use the help of design patterns.\n\n## What is the Singleton Design Pattern?\n\n![](assets/singleton-design-pattern-in-javascript_singleton-pattern.webp)\n\nSingleton design pattern is the pattern in that we only create one static instance of the class.\n\nWhich can be accessed in all components, and functions without recreating or conflicting the instances.\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\n// Filename: singleton.js\n\nclass MyNameClass {\n  constructor() {\n    this._name\n  }\n\n  set name(value) {\n    this._name = value\n  }\n\n  get name() {\n    return this._name\n  }\n}\n\nconst Singleton = function () {\n  let instance\n\n  function createInstance() {\n    return new MyNameClass()\n  }\n\n  return {\n    getInstance: function () {\n      if (!instance) {\n        instance = createInstance()\n      }\n      return instance\n    },\n  }\n}\n\nexport const singleton = Singleton()\n```\n\nThe `createInstance` function for creating the instance of `MyNameClass`.\n\nWhen requested the instance from `MyNameClass`, the method `getInstance` will be invoked. In the `getInstance` method only creating new `MyNameClass` when the instance of the class is not created and return the created instance.\n\n```javascript\n// Filename: index.js\n\nimport { singleton } from './Singleton'\n\nfunction main() {\n  const instanceOne = singleton.getInstance()\n  instanceOne.name = 'John Doe'\n\n  const instanceTwo = singleton.getInstance()\n  console.log('The second instance with name: ', instanceTwo.name)\n  // Output - The second instance with name: John Doe\n\n  console.log('Is same instance? ', instanceOne === instanceTwo)\n  // Output - Is same instance?  true\n}\n\nmain()\n```\n\n- At first we assign `instanceOne` variable with the instance returned from the `singleton.getInstance()`\n- Then we set the `name` from `instanceOne` with value is `John Doe`\n- After that, we create another constant `instantTwo` with the `singleton` object again.\n- This time we will make a compare from the value to the instance, from the output that we can see the `name` from `instanceTwo` is same as the value we already set from `instanceOne` (is `John Doe` and is not `undefined` value), and both instance is the same with the returned is `true`.\n\n## Pros and Cons\n\n### Pros\n\n- You can be sure that a class has only a single instance.\n- A global access point to that instance.\n- The singleton only initialized once.\n\n### Cons\n\n- The Singleton is violate to the Single Responsibility Principle, via the SRP definition that a class only should only have one responsibility. But with the singleton pattern, it can carry too many responsibilities at the same time, this can make a deadlock when used in concurrency / multi-threads.\n- The singleton design is getting us difficult to write the unit test.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith the only initialized once and can use in the global context, the singleton design pattern is very useful for some specific cases where we only need to store the data that using in the global and fewer changes like database connection, user profile account config...\n","title":"Singleton Design Pattern in Javascript","short_title":"","description":"The Singleton design pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.","tags":["frontend","design-pattern"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["chinhld12"],"date":"Sun Oct 16 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/singleton-design-pattern-in-javascript.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","singleton-design-pattern-in-javascript"]},{"content":"\nFrontend development has become increasingly complex over the years, and with it, the need for efficient state management. Global State is one such programming pattern that has emerged as a solution to the problem of prop drilling. Prop drilling is the process of passing data through multiple levels of nested components, which can make code difficult to maintain. By managing and sharing state across multiple components, Global State reduces the need to pass data through each component, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.\n\nWhile Global State is convenient, it has its limitations, particularly when it comes to server-state data. Most applications consume and manipulate data from synchronous and asynchronous sources, commonly referred to as Client State and Server State. Historically, developers have treated both types of state as Global State.\n\n```js\nconst globalState = {\n  // Client state\n  isMenuOpen: false,\n  alerts: [...],\n  // Server state\n  user: {...},\n  cart: {...},\n  orders: [...],\n  customers: [...],\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nHowever, Server State and Client State differ in nature. While Client State is entirely controlled by the client, Server State is remotely persisted. The source of truth is outside of the application's control, and when dealing with data that changes frequently, it's crucial to keep Global State in sync with the remote world. This synchronization requires dealing with caching, outdated requests, updating data in the background, and memory management—factors that ensure efficient data handling and prevent performance issues.\n\nRedux users may already be familiar with the challenges of storing API responses in Global State, which requires boilerplate code to handle loading state, error state, and revalidation when data becomes stale.\n\nFortunately, libraries are available to deal with Server State more effectively than Global State. Two popular libraries among developers are [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) and [React-Query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/). While these libraries have differences, their purpose is the same: to provide a simple interface for storing asynchronous data and abstract away the complexity of dealing with server-state data.\n\nConsider the following code comparison between Redux and React-Query:\n\n```js\n// Redux\nexport const fetchUser = createAsyncThunk('user/fetchUser', async () =\u003e {\n  const response = await fetch('/api/user');\n  const data = await response.json();\n  return data;\n});\n\nconst userSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'user',\n  initialState: { data: {}, loading: false, error: null },\n  reducers: { ... },\n  extraReducers: (builder) =\u003e {\n    builder.addCase(fetchUser.pending, (state) =\u003e {\n      state.loading = true;\n      state.error = null;\n    });\n    builder.addCase(fetchUser.fulfilled, (state, action) =\u003e {\n      state.loading = false;\n      state.data = action.payload;\n    });\n    builder.addCase(fetchUser.rejected, (state, action) =\u003e {\n      state.loading = false;\n      state.error = action.error.message;\n    });\n  },\n});\n\n// React-Query\nconst { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery('user', fetch('/api/user'))\n```\n\nIn this comparison, Redux requires more lines of code and additional boilerplate to handle loading and error states. On the other hand, React-Query simplifies the process significantly, making it easier for developers to maintain the code.\n\nIn conclusion, Global State management is useful in many ways, but its limitations should be considered when deciding whether to use it. If state comes from Server sources, it's important to assess whether it should be treated as Global State or not. In cases where dealing with server-state data is necessary, libraries like SWR and React Query can simplify the process by abstracting the complexities.\n","title":"Tackling Server State complexity in Frontend Development","short_title":"","description":"Frontend development has become increasingly complex over the years, and with it, the need for efficient state management.","tags":["frontend","state-mangement","react","global-state-management"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh"],"date":"Sat Mar 11 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/tackling-server-state-complexity-in-frontend-development.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","tackling-server-state-complexity-in-frontend-development"]},{"content":"\nThe key to improving your website speed is to understand where the bottlenecks are, and how much time each step takes. When we talk about web performance basically we talk about either the two aspects: network latency and browser rendering.\n\n## Network latency\n\nNetwork latency is related to how long it takes for a request to be sent from your computer to the server and back again, and then rendered by the browser. It is affected by many factors, including your ISP speed, DNS lookup, TCP handshakes, the number of hops between you and the server, request processing time on the server and so on. If your website uses a lot of static assets (images, videos, etc), it will take longer for all of these requests to be sent over the network, which can negatively impact page load times.\n\nThere are numerous ways to improve network latency but following are the key points:\n\n- Locate the server close to the client\n- Reduce server response time (logic optimization, setup cache layer,...)\n- Make file size smaller by using techniques such as code splitting or compressor\n- Preload resources using resource hint\n- Use a CDN\n\n## Browser rendering\n\nBrowser rendering is how long it takes for your browser to display your page after receiving all of its data. The process contains a series of steps that the browser performs on a web page to display on the screen. Each of these individual steps is complex and has been optimized over time by browser vendors.\n\nThere are many different browsers out there, but they all perform the same basic set of steps when rendering a webpage. These steps can be broken down into 2 parts:\n\n- Parsing static assets (HTML, CSS, JS)\n- Running pixels-to-screen pipeline\n\nParsing is a static process that doesn't depend on the state of the application. The browser needs to read your HTML and CSS and map them into an internal tree structure. This tree is then used to render the page on screen. This phase is usually very fast, but it does take time - especially if you have a lot of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in your page. The steps in this phase includes:\n\n- Construct Document Object Model (DOM) based on the HTML\n- Construct Cascading Style Sheet Object Model (CSSOM) based on the CSS\n- Combine DOM and CSSOM to generate the render tree. It has all the style properties for every node of the DOM that is needed to be rendered.\n\n![](assets/the-fundamental-of-web-performance-render-tree.webp)\n\nIn addition to parsing, browsers also run pixel pipelines on each frame. Pixel pipelines are basically a bunch of algorithms that take information from the DOM and apply it onto the screen. For example: painting backgrounds (CSS), applying effects (SVG filters) or animating things (CSS transitions). These algorithms are executed every single time there's a change in state (e.g. scroll position changes), causing them to be executed many times per second - even if nothing has changed. There are five major areas that you need to know about and be mindful of when you work\n\n- **JavaScript**: JavaScript execution normally is used to modify the DOM. For example, you can add event listeners or create new elements.\n- **Style calculations**: The browser determines which CSS rules apply to which elements.\n- **Layout**: The browser figures out where each element should be positioned on the screen (which includes things like width, height and position).\n- **Paint**: Once the layout has been calculated, the browser paints every visible element on the screen.\n- **Compositing**: Once all elements have been painted, they are combined together into one image that contains everything that will be displayed onscreen at once — known as a frame.\n\n![](assets/the-fundamental-of-web-performance-pixel-pipeline.webp)\n\nThe goal of delivering a fast, smooth transition web application is **to do less work** during the rendering process. You need to understand how HTML, JavaScript and CSS are handled by browsers as each phase occurs. Then ensure that the code you write (and the other 3rd party code you include) runs as efficiently as possible. For example, to reduce the amount of time it takes for style calculations to be completed, understand [CSS specificity](https://web.dev/learn/css/specificity/) so you can write simple class names and reduce the number of styles that affect a given element.\n\n## Reference\n\n- [Katie Sylor Miller :: Happy Browser, Happy User!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAKD_Ob0XTQ\u0026t=568s\u0026ab_channel=estellevw)\n- https://web.dev/rendering-performance/\n- https://codeburst.io/painting-and-rendering-optimization-techniques-in-browser-2e53a70e7ee\n- https://web.dev/critical-rendering-path-render-tree-construction/\n","title":"The fundamental of web performance","short_title":"","description":"The key to improving your website speed is to understand where the bottlenecks are, and how much time each step takes.","tags":["frontend","frontend/performance","performance"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh"],"date":"Sun Oct 02 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/the-fundamental-of-web-performance.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","the-fundamental-of-web-performance"]},{"content":"\n**ThreeJS** is a JavaScript 3D library that allows developers to develop and describe data in 3 dimensions, and then convert them into 2 dimensions and display them on [HTML Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement).

Instead, use the `PerspectiveCamera` or `OrthographicCamera` specifically. The **perspective camera** gives information about depth, distances, etc. since it represents perspective in **real life**. On the other hand, with an **orthographic camera**, all sizes are projected the same way and we can easily compare them accurately.\n\nThe image below shows the object viewed in **perspective camera** (upper) and in **orthographic camera** (lower).\n\n![](assets/cameras-in-threejs_va74b4e.webp)\n\nPlace them into the **Oxyz** coordinate...\n\n![](assets/cameras-in-threejs_uioctax.webp)\n\n### Perspective camera\n\n![](assets/cameras-in-threejs_oipfgw7.webp)\n\nSome crucial attributes:\n\n- **fov** (field of view): Camera frustum **vertical** field of view, i.e. the angle of the view in the yOz plane, in degree. The lower the number, the narrower the view. ![](assets/cameras-in-threejs_zkoiiim.webp)\n- **near** and **far**: Clipping planes at 2 points on the z axis. Note that objects with z position outside the `(near, far)` interval will **not** be displayed.\n\n```javascript\nconst camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(45, 16 / 9, 1, 1000)\nscene.add(camera)\n```\n\nIn the example above, a perspective camera is initialized with `fov` of 45 degree, `aspect-ratio` of 16 / 9, `near` and `far` of 1 and 1000 respectively.\n\nPerspective camera visualization from [r105.threejsfundamentals.org](https://r105.threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/threejs-cameras-perspective-2-scenes.html) with [`CameraHelper`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=camera#api/en/helpers/CameraHelper):\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"400\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"ThreeJS - Cameras - Perspective 2 views\" src=\"https://codepen.io/nguyend-nam/embed/abGmYBp?default-tab=result\" frameborder=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n### Orthographic camera\n\n![](assets/cameras-in-threejs_cx1u9zi.webp)\n\nSome crucial attributes:\n\n- **left**, **right**, **top** and **bottom**: Horizontal and vertical position of 4 segments of the view.\n- **near** and **far**: Same as for perspective camera.\n\n```javascript\nconst camera = new THREE.OrthographicCamera(-2, 2, 1, -1, 1, 1000)\nscene.add(camera)\n```\n\nIn the example above, an orthographic camera is initialized with `left`, `right`, `top` and `bottom` equal -2, 2, 1 and -1 respectively. The last 2 numbers represent `near` and `far`.\n\nOrthographic camera visualization from [r105.threejsfundamentals.org](https://r105.threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/threejs-cameras-orthographic-2-scenes.html) with [`CameraHelper`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=camera#api/en/helpers/CameraHelper):\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"400\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"ThreeJS - Cameras - Orthographic 2 views\" src=\"https://codepen.io/nguyend-nam/embed/BaxLrWv?default-tab=result\" frameborder=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Other types of camera\n\nBeside those 2 most frequently used cameras, ThreeJS also provides various options:\n\n- [ArrayCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=camera#api/en/cameras/ArrayCamera)\n- [CubeCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=camera#api/en/cameras/CubeCamera)\n- [StereoCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=camera#api/en/cameras/StereoCamera)\n\n## Reference\n\n- https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=camera#api/en/cameras/Camera\n- https://r105.threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-cameras.html\n- https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/isometric-and-perspective-drawings-vector-7297379\n- https://wiki.freecadweb.org/index.php?title=File:Orthographic_Perspective.gif\n- https://www.celestron.com/blogs/knowledgebase/what-is-the-field-of-view-of-a-pair-of-binoculars\n","title":"Cameras in ThreeJS","short_title":"","description":"**ThreeJS** is a JavaScript 3D library that allows developers to develop and describe data in 3 dimensions, and then convert them into 2 dimensions and display them on [HTML Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement).

For example, when a user back history from a screen and then revisit it, React should be able to show the previous screen right away. React would do this by un-mounting and re-mounting trees with the same component state as before.\n- This functionality will improve the performance of React projects out of the box, but necessitate components to be resilient to effects being mounted and un-mounted several times. The majority of effects will operate as-is, however some will presume they are only mounted or destroyed once (which means the new behavior might cause trouble for the existing use of useEffect that intends to trigger mount and unmount once).\n- React 18 adds a new development-only check in StrictMode to identify these issues. After a component mounts for the first time, this new check will immediately unmount and remount it, restoring the previous state on the second mount.\n\n### What are the differences?\n\n- In React 17 the useEffect hook gets call every time the component is mounted.\n- In React 18 each component is mounted, then unmounted, and then remounted and an useEffect call with no dependencies will be run double-time in strict mode.\n\n### Example of useEffect in React 18\n\nWe can confirm the behavior by using the cleanup function of the useEffect hook.\n\n```js\nuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n  console.log('Hello Dwarves!')\n  return () =\u003e console.log('Cleanup..')\n}, [])\n```\n\nThe output to the console should look like this:\n\n```sh\nHello Dwarves!\nCleanup..\nHello Dwarves!\n```\n\n**Solution**\n\nEmbrace the double-firing and make sure your clean up function works (so double-firing in development doesn't hurt).\n\n**Get around (not recomended)**\n\nYou can create a custom hook so that the useEffect get called only once, although this approach can cause leaks and overall not the best practice in engineering.\n\n```ts\nexport const useEffectOnce = (effect: () =\u003e void | (() =\u003e void)) =\u003e {\n  const destroyFunc = useRef\u003cvoid | (() =\u003e void)\u003e()\n  const effectCalled = useRef(false)\n  const renderAfterCalled = useRef(false)\n  const [val, setVal] = useState\u003cnumber\u003e(0)\n\n  if (effectCalled.current) {\n    renderAfterCalled.current = true\n  }\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    // only execute the effect first time around\n    if (!effectCalled.current) {\n      destroyFunc.current = effect()\n      effectCalled.current = true\n    }\n\n    // this forces one render after the effect is run\n    setVal((val) =\u003e val + 1)\n\n    return () =\u003e {\n      // if the comp didn't render since the useEffect was called,\n      // we know it's the dummy React cycle\n      if (!renderAfterCalled.current) {\n        return\n      }\n      if (destroyFunc.current) {\n        destroyFunc.current()\n      }\n    }\n  }, [])\n}\n```\n\n#### Reference\n\n- https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html#new-strict-mode-behaviors\n- https://www.techiediaries.com/react-18-useeffect/\n- https://dev.to/ag-grid/react-18-avoiding-use-effect-getting-called-twice-4i9e\n","title":"useEffect double calls in React 18","short_title":"","description":"In the React 18 version, the `useEffect` hook has been updated to called twice compare to only one in the older version in StrictMode.","tags":["frontend","react","useEffect"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["namtrhg"],"date":"Sat Jun 11 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/useeffect-double-calls-in-react-18.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","useeffect-double-calls-in-react-18"]},{"content":"\n## Website Accessibility\n\nWebsite Accessibility is a term for approaching a website of which the potential user are people with disabilities (eye disorders or illiterate). This audience type can’t be able to approach a visualize website. They must depend on keyboard or Screen Reader supporting tool instead.\n\nWebsite Accessibility is also a factor to evaluate the website quality of Google Lighthouse. Developers can enhance the accessibility of a website by categorizing the current elements, as long as the reader system can identify and have those elements delivered to readers.\n\n## Why we need to use the correct HTML\n\nFor example, a control button to play a video on your site could be marked up like this:\n\n```javascript\n\u003cdiv\u003ePlay video\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nBut as you'll see in greater detail later on, it makes sense to use the correct element for the job:\n\n```javascript\n\u003cbutton\u003ePlay video\u003c/button\u003e\n```\n\nNot only do HTML `\u003cbutton\u003e`s have some suitable styling applied by default (which you will probably want to override), they also have built-in keyboard accessibility — users can navigate between buttons using the Tab key and activate their selection using `Return` or `Enter`.\n\nSemantic HTML doesn't take any longer to write than non-semantic (bad) markup if you do it consistently from the start of your project. Even better, semantic markup has other benefits beyond accessibility:\n\n1. **Easier to develop with** — as mentioned above, you get some functionality for free, plus it is arguably easier to understand.\n2. **Better on mobile** — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than non-semantic spaghetti code, and easier to make responsive.\n3. **Good for SEO** — search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantic `\u003cdiv\u003e`s, etc., so your documents will be more findable by customers.\n","title":"Using Correct Html Element To Increase Website Accessibility","short_title":"","description":"Using the correct HTML element can significantly improve the accessibility of your website.","tags":["html","frontend","accessibility"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh"],"date":"Fri Aug 23 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/using-correct-html-element-to-increase-website-accessibility.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","using-correct-html-element-to-increase-website-accessibility"]},{"content":"\n**Zod** is the TypeScript-first schema validation library with static type inference. It's functional approach to data validation is [parse-dont-validate-in-typescript]() which parses the data in order to validate and catch errors.\n\n## Why use Zod?\n\n- **TypeScript Support:** Zod has TypeScript support, which lets developers to detect type issues early on, making it easier to discover and repair bugs.\n- **Improved data quality:** Developers may guarantee that the data they are working with is in the right format and fulfills particular restrictions by utilizing Zod to validate and coerce input data. This can assist to reduce mistakes and enhance data quality overall.\n- **Simplified code:** Developers may easily design and maintain validation code because to Zod's clear and simple syntax for constructing schemas. This can assist to decrease the amount of boilerplate code required and make it easier to reason about the data flowing through an application.\n- **Flexibility:** Zod may be used in a number of situations, including online forms, REST APIs, and others. It also allows developers to construct custom validation methods, allowing them to validate data using their own business logic.\n- **Lightweight:** Zod is a lightweight library with no external dependencies.\n- **Cross-platform:** Zod works in both browser and Node.js, allowing it to be utilized in a wide range of applications and environments.\n\n## How to use Zod\n\n### Example using validate method\n\n```ts\nconst z = require('zod')\n\n// Define a schema for the input data\nconst schema = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n  phone_number: z.number().min(0).max(12),\n  email: z.string().email(),\n})\n\n// Input data to be validated and coerced\nconst input = {\n  name: 'Dwarves Foundation',\n  phone_number: 123456,\n  email: 'team@dwarves.foundation',\n}\n\n// Validate and coerce the input data\nconst data = schema.validate(input)\nconsole.log(data)\n/*\n{\n  name: 'Dwarves Foundation',\n  phone_number: 123456,\n  email: 'team@dwarves.foundation',\n}\n*/\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a schema using the Zod library that specifies the types and constraints for the input data. The `schema.validate(input)` function is used to validate and coerce the input data to match the schema. If the input data is valid and meets all the constraints defined in the schema, it will be returned in a proper format, otherwise it will throw an error with the validation issues.\n\nIn this case, the input data is an object that has a name, phone number, and email address. According to the standard, the name and email should be strings, and the phone number should be a number between 0 and 12.\n\nIt also ensure that the email is valid email.\n\nThis way the application can be sure that the data it is receiving is in the correct format, and that any issues with the data will be caught early on.\n\n### Example using parse method\n\nThe `parse()` method in the Zod validation library is used to parse and validate input data, and return the parsed data in the correct format. It is similar to the `validate()` method, but it also removes any extra properties from the input data that are not defined in the schema.\n\n```ts\nconst z = require('zod');\n\n// Define a schema for the input data\nconst schema = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n  phone_number: z.number().min(0).max(12),\n  email: z.string().email(),\n});\n\n// Input data to be parsed and validated\nconst input = {\n  name: 'Dwarves Foundation',\n  phone_number: 123456\n  email: 'team@dwarves.foundation',\n  extra_property: 'This should not be included in the output'\n};\n\n// Parse and validate the input data\nconst data = schema.parse(input);\nconsole.log(data);\n/*\n{\n  name: 'Dwarves Foundation',\n  phone_number: 123456,\n  email: 'team@dwarves.foundation',\n}\n*/\n```\n\nIn this example, the input data contains an extra property `extra_property` which is not defined in the schema, it will be removed from the parsed data, resulting in a cleaner object without any unnecessary properties.\n\n`parse()` method is useful when the input data may contain extra properties that are not needed by the application. It also ensures that the input data matches the schema and that any issues with the data will be caught early on.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that, like `validate()`, if the incoming data does not match the schema, `parse()` will throw an exception indicating the validity issues.\n\n## Zod vs Yup\n\n**Zod** and **Yup** are both JavaScript libraries for data validation, but they have some key differences:\n\n- Syntax: Zod and Yup have different syntax for defining schemas. Zod uses a fluent interface with a chainable API, while Yup uses a plain object to define the schema.\n- TypeScript Support: Zod is built with TypeScript, which means it has excellent typings, making it easy to use in a TypeScript environment. Yup does not have built-in TypeScript support, but it can be used in a TypeScript environment with the use of an additional package.\n- Error message: Yup allows to specify custom error messages for each field, which can be useful for displaying error messages to the end-user. Zod, on the other hand, does not provide a way to specify custom error messages.\n- Utility functions: Zod provides a number of utility functions such as the ability to extract values from an object based on a schema, and to create an object with default values based on a schema. Yup does not have similar utility functions.\n- Performance: Zod is smaller in size and it's faster than Yup, which means it could be a better choice for applications that need to handle a large amount of data validation.\n- Popularity: Yup is more popular than Zod because it's been around longer and has a larger community of developers.\n\nBoth Zod and Yup are robust validation libraries, and the choice between them is based on your project's specific demands, syntax preference, and the capabilities that you require.\n\n## References\n\n- \u003chttps://zod.dev/\u003e\n- \u003chttps://github.com/jquense/yup\u003e\n- \u003chttps://blog.logrocket.com/comparing-schema-validation-libraries-zod-vs-yup/\u003e\n- \u003chttps://blog.logrocket.com/schema-validation-typescript-zod/\u003e\n","title":"Validation with Zod","short_title":"","description":"Zod is the TypeScript-first schema validation library with static type inference.","tags":["frontend","parsing","typescript"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["namtrhg"],"date":"Tue Jan 17 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/validation-with-zod.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","validation-with-zod"]},{"content":"\n## What's variable font?\n\nVariable fonts - officially known as OpenType Font Variations - are a font format that allows for a single font file to contain multiple variations of a typeface, such as different weights, widths, and styles, that can be dynamically adjusted in real-time using font variations.\n\n![](assets/variable-fonts_variable_fonts_01.webp)\n\nWeights, widths and other properties are also called **\"axes\" of variations**.\n\n### Axes of Variations\n\nIn typography and font design, \"axes of variation\" refer to the different characteristics or parameters of a font that can be modified or adjusted to create different font styles or variations. These variations can include parameters such as font weight, width, slant, optical size, and more.\n\nEach axis of variation defines a range of possible values, and any combination of values within that range can be used to create a unique font style or variation.\n\n\u003e For example, the weight axis of a variable font might range from \"Thin\" to \"Bold,\" and any value within that range can be selected to create a font style with a corresponding weight.\n\n![](assets/variable-fonts_variable_fonts_02.webp)\n\nBy adjusting these parameters within a defined range, designers can create custom font styles that fit their specific design needs.\n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-assets/variable-fonts/roboto-dance.mp4\" controls autoplay\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\n\nThese variations are also dependent on how the fonts were designed and built. Designers and developers should refer to the font's documentation or its creator to understand which variations are available and how they can be used.\n\n## Why should we use variable fonts?\n\n- **Size and efficiency**: Font variations are contained within a single font file, leading to smaller file sizes and faster load times.\n- **Flexibility, customization, precision and control**: By allowing manipulating of various variation axes to match our needs\n- **Creativity**: Variable fonts provide designers with new opportunities to experiment and create unique font designs, resulting in visually distinct and more memorable typography\n\n## Examples on variable fonts\n\nThe best way to understand variable fonts is to start playing with them. Below are some examples from [an article](introducing-variable-fonts-fonts-knowledge-google-fontshttps/fontsgoogle.com/knowledge/introducing_type/introducing_variable_fonts) from Google Fonts to get you started.\n\nGo to [etceteratype.co/epilogue](https://etceteratype.co/epilogue) and play with the **weight** axis of Epilogue to see how it affects the overall spacing of the ![](assets/variable-fonts_variable_fonts_03.webp)\n\nNow go to [etceteratype.co/grandstander](https://etceteratype.co/grandstander) and compare that with Grandstander, which was designed to take up the same amount of horizontal space regardless of changes made to the weight axis. This shows how what happens within an axis of variation is determined by the typeface designer.\n\n![](assets/variable-fonts_variable_fonts_04.webp)\n\nGo to [etceteratype.co/anybody](https://etceteratype.co/anybody) and play with the weight **and** width axes on Anybody, to see how they can be combined, and how they affect each other in a subtle way:\n\n![](assets/variable-fonts_variable_fonts_05.webp)\n\nYou can also visit these websites:\n\n- [VariableFonts.io](https://variablefonts.io/)\n- [VariableFonts.TypeNetwork.com](https://variablefonts.typenetwork.com/)\n- [Axis-Praxis](https://www.axis-praxis.org/)\n- [Variable Fonts](https://v-fonts.com/)\n- [Font Playground](https://play.typedetail.com/)\n- [Very Able Fonts](https://www.very-able-fonts.com/)\n\n## How do we use variable fonts (as a developer)?\n\n### Load the fonts\n\nVariable fonts are loaded though the same `@font-face` mechanism as traditional static web fonts, with a new enhancement:\n\n```css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Roboto Flex';\n  src: url('RobotoFlex-VF.woff2') format('woff2') tech('variations'), url('RobotoFlex-VF.woff2') format('woff2-variations');\n}\n```\n\nWe don't want the browser to download the font if it doesn't support variable fonts, so we add format and tech descriptions: once in the future syntax `(format('woff2') tech('variations'))`, once in the deprecated but supported among browsers syntax `(format('woff2-variations'))`. They both point to the same font file.\n\n### Using variation axes\n\nTo set value for the variations, we use `font-variation-settings`, specifying an array of `{{axis tag}} {{value}}` pairs:\n\n```css\n\n@font-face {\n  ...\n  font-variation-settings: 'wght' 500, 'GRADE' 0.5;\n}\n```\n\nYou will notice that in the example above, 1 tag is lowercase, and the other is uppercase. It is to differentiate between **registered axes** \u0026 **custom axes**. Registered axes will always be lowercase, whereas custom axes will always be uppercase.\n\nBy default, there are 5 [registered axes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/dvaraxisreg#registered-axis-tags), which control known, predictable features of the font:\n\n- Weight - `wght`\n- Width - `wdth`\n- Optical size - `opsz`\n- Slant - `slnt`\n- Italics - `ital`\n\nBeyond that, we depends on how the fonts were built \u0026 what custom axes they are using. Check out [this site](https://v-fonts.com/fonts/roboto-flex) for another good example on all the axes a font can have.\n\n![](assets/variable-fonts_variable_fonts_06.webp)\n\n## References\n\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fVymQ7SZw0\u0026list=WL\u0026index=1\u0026t=247s\u0026ab_channel=KevinPowell\n- https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/introducing_type/introducing_variable_fonts\n- https://web.dev/variable-fonts/\n","title":"Variable Fonts","short_title":"","description":"Variable fonts are a font format that allows for a single font file to contain multiple variations of a typeface.","tags":["frontend","css","fonts","variable-fonts"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["ngolapnguyen"],"date":"Mon Mar 06 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/variable-fonts.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","variable-fonts"]},{"content":"\nBefore ES modules was supported in the browser, we have no native mechanism for authoring [javascript-modules]() in a modularized fashion. That is why the concept of **\"bundling\"** and tools like Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel exist to improve the development experience for frontend developers.\n\nHowever, when our project started to expand more, the amount of modules might increase from a hundred to thousands of modules which lead to performance bottleneck for **JavaScript-based** toolings.\n\n### Why Vite faster\n\nVite takes full advantage of the availability of native ES modules in the browser and the rise of JavaScript tools written in compile-to-native languages by introducing `pre-bundles dependancies` using `esbuild` which was written in Go which is 10-100x faster than JavaScript-based bundlers.\n\n### Server built architecture\n\n#### Bundle based dev server\n\nBundle-based dev server like Webpack built your application by combining all the source-code and modules into a JavaScript-based bundle, everything is done on the server-side and when you change something, the entire application has to build from the start.\n\n![](assets/bundler.37740380.png)\n\n#### Native ESM based dev server\n\nVite's approach was instead of bundling all everything on the server, it only bundles modules when the browser requires them through HTTP request.\n\nThis architecture provides a faster dev server by avoiding bundling all the application on the server and utilizing the power of modules handling of the browsers.\n\n![](assets/esm.3070012d.png)\n\n### Update when built\n\nRebuilding the whole bundle after making changes to your source code in a bundler-based build system is inefficient for the obvious reason that the update speed would degrade linearly with the app's size.\n\n**HMR (Hot module replacement)** is applied to native ESM in Vite. Vite consistently performs HMR updates quickly regardless of the size of your application by only needing to precisely invalidate the chain between the updated module and its nearest HMR boundary when a file is changed.\n\n### Why Bundle for Production\n\nDespite the fact that native ESM is now generally supported, deploying unbundled ESM in production is still wasteful (even with HTTP/2) since nested imports require extra network round trips. It is still preferable to bundle your code with tree-shaking, lazy-loading, and common chunk splitting to get the best loading performance in production (for better caching).\n\n### Why not bundle with ESBuild?\n\nWhile `esbuild` is lightning-quick and a very capable bundler for libraries, some crucial features required for bundling apps, specifically code-splitting and CSS handling, are still **under development**. `Rollup` is currently more capable and adaptable in several areas and being used in production.\n\n### References\n\n- https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html\n- https://www.telerik.com/blogs/whats-vite-guide-modern-super-fast-project-tooling\n","title":"ViteJS native modules","short_title":"","description":"ViteJS takes full advantage of the availability of native ES modules in the browser and the rise of JavaScript tools written in compile-to-native languages by introducing pre-bundles dependancies using esbuild.","tags":["frontend","native-modules","vitejs","esm"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["namtrhg"],"date":"Mon Jul 04 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/vitejs-native-modules.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","vitejs-native-modules"]},{"content":"\nSince modern websites and applications contain huge amounts of dynamic content and complex components with no semantics to describe what they mean, users with disabilities, those dependent on **assistive technologies** such as **[Screen Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn/related?hl=en)**, text-to-speech or screen magnification tools might suffer to interact with those components.\n\nWeb Accessibility Initiative’s Accessible Rich Internet Applications or simply **WAI-ARIA** is a technology that can help with such problems.\n\n## What is WAI-ARIA?\n\nBefore semantic elements like `\u003cnav\u003e` or `\u003cfooter\u003e` were introduced that define specific features of a web page, some developers would rely on JavaScript libraries that generate a bunch of **nested `\u003cdiv\u003e`s**, then styled them with CSS and controlled with JavaScript.\n\nThe website still works fine and behaves normally. The problem comes when the site is used by a user dependent on assistive technologies, tools that help users with disabilities interact with websites (by speaking the content or information out loud, zoom into the content at the cursor position etc.). If those tools cannot make any sense of what the components are since no semantics were provided, they cannot assist their users. WAI-ARIA provides 3 main features: **Roles**, **States** and **Properties** to solve this problem, giving an opportunity to add attributes to content and components that make them **meaningful** and enhance **accessibility**.\n\n### Roles:\n\nWAI-ARIA roles define **what that HTML is or does**, add the required additional information in cases the markup does not provide the required role. If we write `\u003ca role=\"button\"\u003e`, the screen reader will recognize it as a button. You can also use roles to describe sections on a web page such as `navigation`, `main` or `banners` etc.\n\n\u003e Detailed documentation about **WAI-ARIA Roles** from MDN [[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles)]\n\n```javascript\n\u003cul role=\"menu\"\u003e\n  \u003cli role=\"menuitem\" aria-selected=\"true\" tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\n    Home\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli role=\"menuitem\" aria-selected=\"false\" tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\n    About\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  ...\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n```\n\nWe can have `button`s, `tab`s,... representing widget roles working as part of larger components, or `heading`, `row`, `rowgroup`,... describing content structure in a page.\n\n### Properties:\n\nRepresent the **data value associated** with the object. When combined with roles, the user agent can supply the assistive technologies with user interface information to convey to the user at any time. Properties are **less** likely to change. `aria-label`, `aria-required` and `aria-describedby` are some instances for WAI-ARIA properties.\n\n\u003e Detailed documentation about **WAI-ARIA States \u0026 Properties** from MDN [[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes)]\n\n```javascript\n\u003cform\u003e\n\t\u003clabel for=\"name\"\u003eEnter your name:\u003c/label\u003e\n\t\u003cinput type=\"text\" name=\"name\" aria-label=\"Name input\" aria-required=\"true\" placeholder=\"Your name\"\u003e\n\n\t\u003clabel for=\"age\"\u003eEnter your age:\u003c/label\u003e\n\t\u003cinput type=\"number\" name=\"age\" aria-label=\"Age input\" aria-required=\"true\" placeholder=\"Your age\"\u003e\n\n\t\u003cinput type=\"submit\"\u003e\n\u003c/form\u003e\n```\n\n### States:\n\nHave the same characteristics as properties, except for one thing that states are frequently changed during the life cycle of the component.

The difference is that the [browser's accessibility APIs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility/WebAccessibilityAPI) will expose that information and the assistive technologies can rely on that information to enhance users' accessibility.\n\nWAI-ARIA will become handy in some cases as listed below:\n\n- WAI-ARIA roles are useful when defining specific **regions on a web page** (e.g. banner, navigation, main,...). ![](assets/wai-aria_r1s3rbm.webp)\n\n- `aria-live` can inform screen reader users when a component is **dynamically updated**.\n\u003ciframe height=\"400\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"WAI-ARIA\" src=\"https://codepen.io/nguyend-nam/embed/WNJKEvy?default-tab=result\" frameborder=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n- Strong support **keyboard users**: some HTML elements already have built-in keyboard accessibility (e.g. `\u003cbuttons\u003e`, `\u003cinputs\u003e`,... where users can navigate to using tab key), but some need JavaScript along with to do that. WAI-ARIA provides `tabindex` attribute to allow focusing on those elements.\n- **Improve accessibility** of non-semantic components: as modern web pages are getting more and more complex, UI components might have a bunch of nested `\u003cdiv\u003e`s inside. WAI-ARIA helps cover that with roles (e.g. button, tablist), it also improves functionality (e.g. `aria-required`).\n\n## Reference\n\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics\n- https://www.maxability.co.in/trainings/advanced-web-accessibility-testing/what-is-wai-aria\n- https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/button/button\n- https://pressbooks.library.torontomu.ca/wafd/chapter/wai-aria-landmarks/#:~:text=WAI%2DARIA%20landmarks%20are%20used,bypass%20links%20and%20page%20headings\n","title":"WAI-ARIA","short_title":"","description":"WAI-ARIA is a technology that can help with the problems of modern websites and applications containing huge amounts of dynamic content and complex components with no semantics to describe what they mean.","tags":["frontend","wai-aria","accessibility"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["nguyend-nam"],"date":"Fri Sep 30 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/wai-aria.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","wai-aria"]},{"content":"\n### What\n\nWebAssembly (abbreviated *Wasm*) was launched in 2017 as a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format, so it’s fast to load, execute, and run with near-native performance. It is designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. That means you do not write WebAssembly, you compile other high-level languages to it.\n\n![](assets/webassembly_wasm-architecture.webp)\n\n### How\n\nWith JavaScript, the code is included in the website and is interpreted as it runs because JavaScript variables are dynamic. The only way to know what the types are for sure is to monitor the code as it executes, which is what the JavaScript engine does. Once the engine is satisfied that it knows the variable’s types, it can convert that section of code into machine code.\n\n![](assets/webassembly_wasm-js-how-it-work.webp)\n\nWebAssembly isn’t interpreted but, rather, is compiled into the WebAssembly binary format by a developer ahead of time. Because the variable types are all known ahead of time, when the browser loads the WebAssembly file, the JavaScript engine doesn’t need to monitor the code. It can simply compile the code’s binary format into machine code.\n\n![](assets/webassembly_wasm-how-it-works.webp)\n\n### High-Level Goals\n\n- Be fast, efficient, and portable -- WebAssembly code can run at near-native speed regardless of platform.\n- Be readable and easily debuggable -- although WebAssembly is a low-level assembler-like language, it has a human-readable text format. This makes it possible to write, read and debug code yourself.\n- Be secure -- Actually, WebAssembly is specified to be run during a safe and sandboxed execution environment. Like other web code, it'll enforce the browser's same-origin and permissions policies.\n- Don’t break the web -- WebAssembly is designed so that it plays nicely with other web technologies and maintains backwards compatibility.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- Image / video editing.\n- Peer-to-peer applications (games, collaborative editing, decentralized and centralized).\n- Music applications (streaming, caching).\n- Live video augmentation.\n- VR and augmented reality (very low latency).\n- Scientific visualization and simulation.\n- Developer tooling (editors, compilers, debuggers, …).\n- Fat client for enterprise applications (e.g. databases).\n\n### Reference\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly https://webassembly.org/ https://livebook.manning.com/book/webassembly-in-action/chapter-1/ https://www.xenonstack.com/insights/a-beginners-guide-to-webassembly\n","title":"Webassembly","short_title":"","description":"WebAssembly (abbreviated *Wasm*) was launched in 2017 as a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format, so it’s fast to load, execute, and run with near-native performance.","tags":["frontend","webassembly","performance","sandbox"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["cor3.co"],"date":"Thu Jan 05 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/frontend/webassembly.md","slugArray":["playground","frontend","webassembly"]},{"content":"\n## What are WebSockets\n\nPreviously, creating web applications that need bidirectional require a HTTP polling for updating the data from the server. This result in lots of problems such as high overhead, latency, not-truthly realtime.\n\nWebSocket is a simple solution that is invented to solve those problems as it helps to maintain one single TCP connection for traffic in both directions. It currently can work over HTTP port 80, 443 and as proxies as it is designed for addressing the other existing bidirectional HTTP technologies so that take advantage of existing HTTP infrastructure.\n\n## The Protocol Overview\n\n### Handshake\n\nA HTTP Handshake is preformed before update to WebSocket connection. The client makes a GET request to the server with an upgrade header. The server then response with status 101 to upgrade the current connection to be WebSocket connection. Otherwise, the client has to end the connection.\n\nExample handshake\n\n#### From client\n\n```javascript\nGET /chat HTTP/1.1\n    Host: server.example.com\n    Upgrade: websocket\n    Connection: Upgrade\n    Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==\n    Origin: http://example.com\n    Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat\n    Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13\n```\n\n- `Sec-WebSocket-Key` is to ensure the server support WebSocket protocol, the key is generated random to preven proxy server to cache and follow the communication\n\n#### From server\n\n```javascript\nHTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols\n    Upgrade: websocket\n    Connection: Upgrade\n    Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=\n    Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat\n```\n\n- `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`: is a response key to show server acceptance, the server first take the value of `Sec-Websocket-Key`, append `\"258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11\"` _(Globally Unique Identifier)_ and then hashed with SHA-1\n\n### Data Transfer\n\nAfter the handshake was successful, each side can start sending or receiving data. The data property in WebSocket is `message`. For each message, the browser is only able to send and receive messages as binary or plain text.\n\nWebSocket uses sequential `frames` for transferring message instead of `streaming`. This result in each side can exchange data independently without any blocking.\n\n#### \\*Framing\n\nA `Frame` is a small `header` + `payload`, the payload is similiar to other application data such as body of a HTTP message. In most basic form of WebSocket protocols include 2 type of frames:\n\n- Non-control frame:\n  - `text` - denotes sending `utf-8` encoded bytes\n  - `binary` - sending raw bytes\n  - `continue` - sending a continuation fragment of previous message\n- Control frame:\n  - `close` - denote that wanting to close, or responding to a close\n  * `ping`\n  * `pong`\n\n_[Read detail here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-5.2)_\n\n#### \\*Authentication\n\nThe protocol itself does not specify an authentication method. User can use any other mechanism used in HTTP such as TLS authentication, cookies or authentication Header _(Except for browser client, WebSocket api does not provide a way to modify the client handshake Header)_.\n\n#### \\*WebSocket URI\n\n```\nws-URI = \"ws:\" \"//\" host [ \":\" port ] path [ \"?\" query ]\nwss-URI = \"wss:\" \"//\" host [ \":\" port ] path [ \"?\" query ]\n```\n\nNote that the differences between `ws` and `wss`is:\n\n- **`ws` use `HTTP` for handshake while `wss` use `HTTPS`**\n- Default port for `ws` is 80 and `wss` is port 443\n\n## WebSocket Browser API\n\nThe browser provide an API for creating and managing WebSocket connection as well as exchange messages with a WebSocket server.\n\n### Open WebSocket connection\n\nWe can instantiate a new WebSocket connection, linking to the WebSocket server, and it will start connecting immediately.\n\n```typescript\nconst socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080')\n```\n\n### WebSocket Events\n\nIn total, there are 4 events we can listen to are `open`, `message`, `error`, and `close`.\n\n```typescript\n// Connection opened\nsocket.addEventListener('open', (event) =\u003e {})\n// Receive messages from server\nsocket.addEventListener('message', (event) =\u003e {})\n// Connection Error\nsocket.addEventListener('error', (event) =\u003e {})\n// After connection closed\nsocket.addEventListener('close', (event) =\u003e {})\n```\n\n**Sending message** The `socket.send(body)` method allow sending a message to the server. The `body` argument can be a `string` or `binary format type` such as `ArrayBuffer`, `Blob`.\n\n#### Receiving message\n\nAccess `event.data` for incomming message\n\n```typescript\nsocket.onmessage = (event) =\u003e {\n  console.log(event.data)\n}\n```\n\n- For Text message, `event.data` will always be `string`\n- For `binary type` message, user can choose between `Blob` and `ArrayBuffer` by assign `WebSocket.binaryType='arraybuffer` _(default is `blob`)_ then `event.data` will be the appropriate type\n\n```typescript\nsocket.binaryType = 'arraybuffer'\nsocket.onmessage = (event) =\u003e {\n  if (event.data instanceof ArrayBuffer) {\n    // Handling binary message\n    return\n  }\n  // Handling String message\n}\n```\n\n### Rate Limiting\n\nWhen user has a slow network connection. After calling `WebSocket.send(...)` the data will be buffered in memory and will be sent out as soon as connection get better\n\n`WebSocket.bufferedArmount` return the amount of data queued using `call()` but not yet send out to the network. _This value will not reset to zero if connection close._\n\n```typescript\nif (socket.bufferedAmount === 0) {\n  socket.send(moreData())\n}\n```\n\n### Close Connection\n\nFor sending `close frame` from browser WebSocket, simply call `WebSocket.close(code, reason)`.\n\n```typescript\nsocket.close(1000, 'Complete') // both argument is optional\nsocket.onclose = (event) =\u003e {\n  const { code, reason, wasClean } = event\n  console.log({ code, reason, wasClean })\n  // { code: 1000, reason: \"Complete\", wasClean: true }\n}\n```\n\n#### \\*Common code\n\n- 1000 - normal closure (default)\n- 1006 - connection was lost (this code cannot set manually, connection close abnormally by the browser and event go to `WebSocket.onerror`)\n- 1001 - the party is going away (server shutting down, browser leave the page)\n- ...\n\n## Connection State\n\nUser can access `WebSocket.readyState` for getting the current state of a WebSocket instance\n\n- `0`: CONNECTING - socket created but connection is not open yet\n- `1`: OPEN - Connection is open and ready to communicate\n- `2`: CLOSING - Connection is in closing process\n- `3`: CLOSED - Connection is closed or could not be opened\n","title":"WebSockets","short_title":"","description":"WebSockets are a simple solution that is invented to solve the problems of HTTP polling for updating the data from the server, which has caused in high overhead, latency, and not-truthly realtime.

Researching PNPM was originally from research on what package manager **[Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/)** uses. We then tried to experiment with it for **[dwarves/react-toolkit](https://github.com/dwarvesf/react-toolkit/pull/46)**, which has given us some insights into some of the cost-benefits of using the package manager._\n\n## Introduction\n\nPNPM is a package manager for Node.js which stands for “Performant NPM”. It was introduced in 2016, the same year Yarn was released. PNPM is a fast, disk space efficient package manager that supports monorepos. It creates a non-flat `node_modules` by default, so code has no access to arbitrary packages. PNPM performs installation in three stages:\n\n1. **Dependency resolution **- The package manager identifies and fetches all required dependencies to the store.\n2. **Directory structure calculation** - Based on these dependencies, it calculates the layout of the `node_modules` directory.\n3. **Linking dependencies** - it retrieves and establishes hard links from the store to `node_modules` for all remaining dependencies.\n\n## Advantages of PNPM\n\nPNPM is a very performant alternative to most package managers. Here are a few advantages of using PNPM:\n\n- Saves disk space by using a content-addressable store for packages\n- Boosts installation speed with a three-stage process\n- Creates a non-flat node_modules directory for larger projects\n\n### Saving Disk Space\n\nSupposing you have 10 Node.js projects on your personal computer if you use NPM/Yarn, you will have 10 `node_modules` folders with a heavy size.\n\nIf you use PNPM, things will be different. It introduces a new concept to us, called a _content-addressable store_. See the image below:\n\n![](assets/what-is-pnpm-compare-to-npmyarn_949760adee1b7a897e0b53044b7b0a89_md5.webp)\n\nAs you can see, PNPM does not store packages in the `node_modules` folder, but rather in the content-addressable store. Therefore, in the `node_modules` folders of projects using PNPM, the packages are _linked_ from the global store.\n\nThanks to this, package versions are only stored once on the disk\n\n### **Boosting installation speed\\*\\***[](https://pnpm.io/motivation#boosting-installation-speed)\\*\\*\n\nPNPM performs installation in three stages:\n\n1. Dependency resolution: identifying and obtaining all necessary dependencies for the store.\n2. Directory structure calculation: determining the layout of the `node_modules` directory based on these dependencies.\n3. Linking dependencies: retrieving and establishing hard links from the store to `node_modules` for all remaining dependencies.\n\n![](assets/what-is-pnpm-compare-to-npmyarn_4cde4958507a5ac4d8e7d614175b57de_md5.webp)\n\nThis approach is significantly faster than the conventional method of identifying, obtaining, and saving all dependencies directly to the `node_modules` directory.\n\n![](assets/what-is-pnpm-compare-to-npmyarn_acaaed15e34c391a1ff6b81bbbf6163f_md5.webp)\n\n### Creating a non-flat node_modules [directory](https://pnpm.io/motivation#creating-a-non-flat-node_modules-directory)\n\nFirst of all, we must ask why NPM chooses the flat `node_modules` structure approach.\n\nGoing back in time, before the release of NPM version 3, at this point, `node_modules` in NPM were still in a non-flat structure. As shown in the example below:\n\n```javascript\nnode_modules\n└─ foo\n   ├─ index.js\n   ├─ package.json\n   └─ node_modules\n      └─ bar\n         ├─ index.js\n         └─ package.json\n```\n\nThis approach has some issues such as:\n\n- The issue of long directory paths on the Windows operating system occurred because the package created a dependency tree that was too deep\n- Packages were copy-pasted in many places because they were required in different dependencies\n\nTherefore, to solve this problem, NPM decided to flatten `node_modules`. After NPM version 3, the structure of the `node_modules` directory will become like this:\n\n```javascript\nnode_modules\n├─ foo\n|  ├─ index.js\n|  └─ package.json\n└─ bar\n   ├─ index.js\n   └─ package.json\n```\n\nConsequently, the source code can access dependencies that are not explicitly declared in the project. Following the example above, even though the project only uses the **foo** package, we can completely use the **bar** package without declaring it in package.json.\n\nUnlike NPM version 3, PNPM tries to solve the issues without flattening the dependency tree. Follow the example below:\n\n```javascript\nnode_modules\n├─ foo -\u003e .registry.npmjs.org/foo/1.0.0/node_modules/foo\n└─ .registry.npmjs.org\n   ├─ foo/1.0.0/node_modules\n   |  ├─ bar -\u003e ../../bar/2.0.0/node_modules/bar\n   |  └─ foo\n   |     ├─ index.js\n   |     └─ package.json\n   └─ bar/2.0.0/node_modules\n      └─ bar\n         ├─ index.js\n         └─ package.json\n---------------------------------------\n-\u003e: a symlink (or junction on Windows)\n```\n\nThe **foo** package still contains its dependency **bar** in the form of a symlink. And what’s special is that **foo** doesn’t have `node_modules` inside, this way the dependency tree of **foo** won’t be as deep as in NPM before the release of v3.\n\nAt first glance, the structure may seem complicated, but when working on larger projects you will see that this structure is clearer than NPM/Yarn\n\n## Disadvantages of PNPM\n\nHowever, there are a few disadvantages of using PNPM. One of them is that it can be slower than other package managers like Yarn or NPM when installing packages for the [first time](https://medium.com/@buffet_time/why-you-should-move-to-pnpm-82962f332418). It can also be difficult to use with some build tools like [Webpack](https://dev.to/stackblitz/what-is-pnpm-and-is-it-really-so-fast-and-space-efficient-29la).\n\nPNPM's node_modules layout uses [symbolic links to create a nested structure of dependencies](https://pnpm.io/symlinked-node-modules-structure). This has some implications for certain setups, where Windows machines or certain permissioned Linux environments may have trouble accessing these links.\n\nAnother potential issue with PNPM is that its nested dependency structure may not be compatible with certain older packages. [This can cause issues when trying to install packages that have dependencies that are not compatible with PNPM’s nested structure](https://pnpm.io/limitations).\n\n## **Showcase**\n\nThankfully, PNPM is employed by numerous large companies, demonstrating its effectiveness. For an updated list, you can visit [https://pnpm.io/users](https://pnpm.io/users).\n\n![](assets/what-is-pnpm-compare-to-npmyarn_55e4a8514dc89f283ed5e6b77d839d42_md5.webp)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPNPM is a package manager for Node.js that offers several advantages over other popular package managers, including saving disk space and boosting installation speed. It also creates a non-flat `node_modules` directory, which can be helpful for larger projects. However, there are some potential disadvantages to using PNPM, such as compatibility issues with certain older packages and slower initial package installation times. Despite these drawbacks, PNPM is used by numerous large companies and may be worth considering for your own projects.\n\nOverall, PNPM offers some unique benefits and is a viable alternative to other package managers for Node.js. It's worth exploring whether it's the right choice for your specific use case.\n\n## References:\n\n- [https://pnpm.io/motivation](https://pnpm.io/motivation)\n- [https://blog.bitsrc.io/pnpm-javascript-package-manager-4b5abd59dc9](https://blog.bitsrc.io/pnpm-javascript-package-manager-4b5abd59dc9)\n- [https://pnpm.io/faq#what-does-pnpm-stand-for](https://pnpm.io/faq#what-does-pnpm-stand-for)\n- [https://medium.com/pnpm/why-should-we-use-pnpm-75ca4bfe7d93](https://medium.com/pnpm/why-should-we-use-pnpm-75ca4bfe7d93)\n- [https://medium.com/@buffet_time/why-you-should-move-to-pnpm-82962f332418](https://medium.com/@buffet_time/why-you-should-move-to-pnpm-82962f332418)\n- [https://dev.to/stackblitz/what-is-pnpm-and-is-it-really-so-fast-and-space-efficient-29la](https://dev.to/stackblitz/what-is-pnpm-and-is-it-really-so-fast-and-space-efficient-29la)\n- [https://refine.dev/blog/pnpm-vs-npm-and-yarn/](https://refine.dev/blog/pnpm-vs-npm-and-yarn/)\n","title":"What is PNPM Compare To NPM/Yarn","short_title":"","description":"PNPM is a package manager for Node.js which stands for “Performant NPM”.

It is simple enough not to use state management libraries. `useState` is surely a choice for the sake of brevity and clarity. But are there any issues we have to deal with? In this article, I want to make some improvements on `useState` hook and how we can replace it with `useReducer` as an alternative solution.\n\n## The problem\n\nLet's take a look at the code below:\n\n```jsx\nfunction EditCalendarEvent() {\n  const [startDate, setStartDate] = useState()\n  const [endDate, setEndDate] = useState()\n  const [title, setTitle] = useState('')\n  const [description, setDescription] = useState('')\n  const [location, setLocation] = useState()\n  const [attendees, setAttendees] = useState([])\n\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      \u003cinput value={title} onChange={(e) =\u003e setTitle(e.target.value)} /\u003e\n      {/* ... */}\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe component is used to update a calendar event. Sadly, it has several problems:\n\n- Using too many `useState` hooks make your code look like a mess, especially when the list of state grows longer and longer.\n- No safeguards. In other words, you may not guarantee that state is updated accurately. There’s nothing preventing you from choosing an end date that’s before the start date. You can validate other related states first but only if you remember (or even know) they exist.\n\n## An improvement of `useState`\n\nTo improve the code above, we can gather all states in one big object:\n\n```jsx\nfunction EditCalendarEvent() {\n  const [event, setEvent] = useState({\n    title: '',\n    description: '',\n    attendees: [],\n  })\n\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      \u003cinput value={event.title} onChange={(e) =\u003e setEvent({ ...event, title: e.target.value })} /\u003e\n      {/* ... */}\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLook better. However, there are still potential pitfalls:\n\n- Always remember to spread on `...event` so you don’t mess up by mutating the object directly and subsequently causing React to not rerender as expected.\n\n- You can validate before updating states but the validations are separated and somehow hard to control all of them.\n\nOne solution is using a curried function:\n\n```jsx\nfunction EditCalendarEvent() {\n  const [event, setEvent] = useState({\n    title: '',\n    description: '',\n    attendees: [],\n  })\n\n  const handleChange = (field) =\u003e (e) =\u003e {\n    // Validate and transform event to ensure state is always valid\n    // in a centralized way\n    // ...\n    setEvent({ ...event, [field]: e.target.value })\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      \u003cinput value={event.title} onChange={handleChange('title')} /\u003e\n      {/* ... */}\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nDo not forget that there are two ways to update state now and make sure you pick the right one or else the curried function will be meaningless.\n\n## Adopting `useReducer` as an alternative to `useState`\n\nMany people know `useReducer`, but a small number of them actually want to use it. With `useReducer`, we could rewrite the code to be like this:\n\n```jsx\nfunction EditCalendarEvent() {\n  const [event, updateEvent] = useReducer(\n    (prev, next) =\u003e {\n      return { ...prev, ...next }\n    },\n    { title: '', description: '', attendees: [] },\n  )\n\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      \u003cinput value={event.title} onChange={(e) =\u003e updateEvent({ title: e.target.value })} /\u003e\n      {/* ... */}\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `useReducer` hook helps you control transformations from state A to state B. This guarantees your states are always valid, in a fully **centralized** way. So with this model, even if the code becomes more complex, new states are added, we can still manage and maintain them without so much effort.\n\n```jsx\nfunction EditCalendarEvent() {\n  const [event, updateEvent] = useReducer(\n    (prev, next) =\u003e {\n      const newEvent = { ...prev, ...next }\n\n      // Ensure that the start date is never after the end date\n      if (newEvent.startDate \u003e newEvent.endDate) {\n        newEvent.endDate = newEvent.startDate\n      }\n\n      // Ensure that the title is never more than 100 chars\n      if (newEvent.title.length \u003e 100) {\n        newEvent.title = newEvent.title.substring(0, 100)\n      }\n      return newEvent\n    },\n    { title: '', description: '', attendees: [] },\n  )\n\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      \u003cinput value={event.title} onChange={(e) =\u003e updateEvent({ title: e.target.value })} /\u003e\n      {/* ... */}\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Other use cases for `useReducer`\n\nAs can be seen from code above, `useReducer` might replace `useState` for \"complex state\", and moreover we do not need to follow the redux style. I still believe `useReducer` is underestimated.\n\nHere is an example of toggling state with `useReducer`:\n\n```jsx\nfunction EditCalendarEvent() {\n  const [value, toggleValue] = useReducer((prev) =\u003e !prev, false)\n\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={toggleValue}\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe implementation is simple, and it really shows the flexibility of `useReducer`.\n\nIf you love Redux, sure, you can adhere the action-based pattern as well. It is important to keep in mind that you must always treat the state value of the `useReducer` hook as immutable. To avoid running into this problem, `Immer` is one of the best choice.\n\n## The conclusion\n\nIn general, developers prefer `useState` to `useReducer`. It is not their fault since `useState` is more familiar and introduced from the very first tutorial of hooks. However, the ability to supply a function that controls state transitions of `useReducer` is great and surely worth your consideration.\n\n## Reference\n\n- https://dev.to/builderio/a-cure-for-react-usestate-hell-1ldi\n","title":"When should we use useReducer instead of useState?","short_title":"","description":"Imagine we have a component with multiple states.

Micro-frontend is an emerging front-end architecture that aims to address these challenges by breaking down the front-end into small, independent and reusable modules.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the concept of micro-frontend, its benefits, design principles, tools and technologies, implementation strategies, and challenges. By the end of this article, you will have a good understanding of what micro-frontend is and why it is important for modern front-end development.\n\n## What is Micro-Frontend?\n\nMicro-Frontend is an architectural pattern for frontend development that emphasizes breaking down the frontend into small, independent and self-contained modules.\n\nEach module is responsible for a specific feature or functionality and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. The modules can then be composed into a complete frontend application, similar to how microservices are composed into a complete backend application.\n\nTo better understand how micro-frontend architecture works, we should first look into what’s **monolithic architecture.**\n\n### The Monolithic Architecture\n\nIn a monolith system, everything resides in one repository and all the developers work on the same code base. For every single change, the entire app needs to be built, tested \u0026 shipped as a whole.\n\nIn a lot of cases, this approach is fine, it works if you do it right and a lot of systems use it efficiently. However, as the software scales, issues might arise. It becomes difficult to upgrade the dependencies due to a big codebase with huge impacts, a lot of time would be spent in coordination between developers, testing and deployments become slower, individual changes cannot be shipped, slowing down the pace of the team bringing value to the clients.\n\nThere might be a need for a more efficient solution - by breaking it down:\n\n![](assets/149cb7501d21ad52e476f168b93085cc_MD5.jpeg) ![](assets/why-micro-frontend_149cb7501d21ad52e476f168b93085cc_md5.webp)\n\nWe can see that the backend work has been broken into microservices - a term we are probably too familiar with at this point. However, front-end work is still one big chunk. This is where micro-frontend comes in.\n\n### The Micro-Frontend Architecture\n\nLet’s take the previous monolithic example (The Shop Team), broken into micro-frontends:\n\n![](assets/8b4ce5b2e752b7bbc96be21b6d2f1349_MD5.jpeg) ![](assets/why-micro-frontend_8b4ce5b2e752b7bbc96be21b6d2f1349_md5.webp) ![](assets/Pasted image 20231101050539.webp) With micro-frontends, codebase, teams, and responsibilities are split vertically in a way that the coupling between them is very low. Each team owns a smaller codebase, and can individually test, deploy and scale according to the needs. Now the teams only need to coordinate the moving parts, which can be kept minimal with a good system design. The teams can easily manage their dependencies and even use a separate tech stack.\n\nFinally, all micro-frontends can be served to the users altogether through a container (shell) app:\n\n![](assets/why-micro-frontend_336c82e3b7bd0e20a3196bd23f043f6a_md5.webp)\n\nNow that we’ve already got the gist of what micro-frontend is, let’s take a closer look at the key benefits it brings.\n\n## Advantages of Micro-Frontend\n\n### Improved Scalability\n\nMicro-frontend allows for individual features or functionalities to be developed, tested, and deployed independently by individual teams, which makes it easier to scale specific areas of the application without affecting others.\n\nOn the other hand, it also lets teams express themselves at their best - they can make the best possible decision in terms of architecture, testing, and coding style based on the business logic they have to tackle.\n\n### Enhanced Flexibility\n\nMicro-frontend allows greater flexibility in development, enabling teams to use the best tools for each micro-frontend as each micro-frontend can be built using different frameworks, technologies, and languages.\n\nTeams can opt for a new technology stack without having to translate what was developed previously, eliminating technology lock-in \u0026 offering opportunities to pick up newer \u0026 better tech stacks. This also helps diversify hiring processes as there are many stacks being used.\n\n### Faster Development \u0026 Deployment\n\nMicro-frontend allows independent teams to work on independent features simultaneously, without communication overhead. Teams can deploy faster, at a higher rate, with a smaller size.\n\n### Better Maintainability\n\nMicro-frontend allows greater autonomy and ownership as each micro-frontend is managed by a dedicated team. It is easier to identify and fix issues, as each team is responsible for a specific feature or functionality.\n\nIt also helps address challenges related to legacy code by enabling teams to rebuild and replace individual micro-frontends without having to rebuild the entire application from scratch.\n\nOf course, while there are many advantages to using a micro-frontend architecture, there are also several challenges and considerations that must be taken into account.\n\n## Challenges and Considerations\n\n![](assets/why-micro-frontend_f956742770614138c3736e182be7da7a_md5.webp)\n\n### Increased complexity\n\nWhile micro-frontends can help break down a large application into smaller, more manageable pieces, they can also introduce additional complexity. Managing the interactions between different micro-frontends, handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication and routing, and coordinating deployment and versioning can all be challenging.\n\n### Performance overhead\n\nEach micro-frontend adds additional overhead to the page, with its own network requests, JavaScript files, and CSS styles. While this can help improve scalability and maintainability, it can also impact page load times and user experience if not managed carefully.\n\n### Browser compatibility\n\nDifferent micro-frontends may have different dependencies and requirements, making it challenging to ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices. This can require additional testing and development efforts to ensure that the application works correctly on all platforms.\n\n### Security concerns\n\nEach micro-frontend represents a potential attack surface for hackers and malicious actors, so it's important to ensure that each micro-frontend is properly secured and isolated from the rest of the application. This can involve implementing security measures like sandboxing, Content Security Policy (CSP), and other best practices.\n\n### Communication between micro-frontends\n\nCoordinating communication between different micro-frontends can be challenging, especially when dealing with complex workflows or data dependencies. This can require careful planning and design to ensure that each micro-frontend can communicate effectively with the others without creating unintended side effects.\n\n### Tooling and infrastructure\n\nBuilding and deploying micro-frontends often requires a different set of tools and infrastructure than traditional monolithic applications. This can involve implementing new build processes, deploying microservices, and managing complex deployment pipelines, which can require additional expertise and resources.\n\nSo, knowing full well the pros and cons of micro-frontend architecture, how should we approach building one? Let’s move on to some design principles.\n\n## Micro-Frontend Design Principles\n\n### Single Responsibility\n\nEach micro-frontend should be responsible for a single aspect of the user interface, rather than trying to do too much. This helps keep the codebase manageable and ensures that changes to one part of the interface don't have unintended consequences elsewhere.\n\n### Loose Coupling\n\nMicro-frontends should be designed to be as independent as possible, with minimal dependencies on other parts of the application. This allows each micro-frontend to be developed, tested, and deployed separately, without affecting other parts of the system.\n\n### Composability\n\nMicro-frontends should be designed to be easily combined with other micro-frontends to create a complete user interface. This means that they should have clear, well-defined interfaces and be designed with reusability in mind.\n\n### Isolation\n\nEach micro-frontend should be fully isolated from the rest of the application, with its own dedicated DOM element and JavaScript execution context. This prevents conflicts between different parts of the UI and ensures that one micro-frontend cannot affect the behavior of others.\n\n### Standardization\n\nTo ensure consistency across different micro-frontends, it's important to establish and adhere to a set of standard design patterns, coding conventions, and UI guidelines. This helps ensure that users have a seamless experience across the entire application.\n\n### Testing\n\nEach micro-frontend should be designed with testing in mind, with a suite of automated tests to verify its functionality and ensure that changes don't introduce regressions. This helps catch bugs early in the development process and ensures that the system remains stable and reliable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith that, we hope you now have a clear idea of what micro-frontend is, its pros and cons, as well as some key principles that ensure this architecture is correctly built.\n\nMicro-frontend is a powerful approach to building web applications, with a focus on scalability and maintainability. It is still growing, with companies such as AWS, IKEA, or DAZN which has begun their own adoption of the technology, and we here at Dwarves Foundation are no exception. We are actively practicing the architecture with some of our partners, including [Mudah](https://www.mudah.my/) and [Setel](https://www.setel.com/).\n\nHowever, please do keep in my that regardless of its strength, Micro-Frontend is not a one-sizes-fit-all solution. Traditional, monolithic architectures still have their charms, and picking which to use for the business remains one of the most important questions we hope to help you answer.\n\nUntil next time!\n\n## References\n\n- [5 Reasons You Should Adopt a Micro Frontend Architecture — SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/micro-frontend-architecture-benefits/)\n- [5 Pitfalls of Using Micro Frontends and How to Avoid Them — SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/micro-frontend-architecture-pitfalls/)\n- [Micro Frontends - A Complete Guide | Hygraph](https://hygraph.com/blog/micro-frontend)\n- [Micro-Frontend—Why and How? | Syncfusion Blogs](https://www.syncfusion.com/blogs/post/micro-frontend-why-and-how.aspx)\n- [Microfrontends Anti-Patterns: Seven Years in the Trenches](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/microfrontend-antipattern/)\n- [Micro Frontends - extending the microservice idea to frontend development (micro-frontends.org)](https://micro-frontends.org/)\n","title":"Why Micro Frontend","short_title":"","description":"As web applications become more complex and feature-rich, traditional frontend architectures such as monolithic will become harder to maintain, scale, and evolve.

Understanding the concept of Virtual DOM sheds light on an important aspect of performance optimization on the client side.\n\nUnder the hood, virtual DOM is a mapping of JavaScript objects to actual DOM. In React, an example of this looks like this:\n\n```js\n{\n  tag: \"ul\",\n  props: {},\n  children: [{\n    tag: \"li\",\n    props: {\n      className: \"item\"\n    },\n    children: [\"item\", 1]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nThe output of the above Virtual DOM is translated to the following HTML:\n\n```html\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli className=\"item\"\u003eitem 1\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n```\n\nWe can see that React implements a one-to-one correspondence between the Virtual DOM and the browser's DOM. However, how is this relationship beneficial to page rendering speed? Let's take a look at a simple example to illustrate how React achieves this efficiency.\n\nWhen a state changes, React performs the following steps:\n\n- Generate a new Virtual DOM\n- Compare the differences between the new Virtual DOM and the previous Virtual DOM\n- Generate a diff object\n- Traverse the diff objects and update the actual DOM\n\nNow let's consider the initial Virtual DOM is the previous state and the below is the new Virtual DOM after a state change:\n\n```js\n{\n  tag: \"ul\",\n  props: {\n    className: 'list'\n\t},\n  children: []\n}\n```\n\nWhen you map the steps to compare an initial virtual DOM with the new virtual DOM, you can see that a series of changes occur:\n\n- Check `ul` tag; nothing has changed, so keep it untouched.\n- Check `ul` props; a new `className` prop appears, register the change in the diff object.\n- Check `children`; the array of children is now empty; register the change in the diff object.\n- Traverse the diff object and do a batch update to modify the actual DOM (which probably invokes `classList.add` and `removeChildren` method).\n\nAfter all, building a new JavaScript object tree and then running a diffing algorithm on the two trees does not sound like it would be performant at all. Why would we need to go through all of those extra steps if, in the end, we are still making the same DOM changes? The purpose of the whole process is to limit the number of times you call a method, and the frequency with which DOM updates occur. We can see this most clearly through the following two scenarios:\n\n- Grouping all updates together and applying them in one batch is a better idea than synchronizing the updates as they occur.\n- Be able to identify unnecessary changes. For example, when a state makes a change to an attribute of an element, and the subsequent state change causes the removal of that element, it's easy to see that the former update is unnecessary.\n\nMinimizing DOM updates is a big win in performance optimization because it reduces the number of computations that must be performed in order to render the page. Because [ DOM manipulation invokes complex algorithms](), \"diffing\" the virtual DOM is much cheaper than performing all of those calculations.\n\nAn important point to note here is that we need to correct the assumption that the Virtual DOM is fast. This isn't actually the case—it's slow. However, it is faster than performing unnecessary real DOM updates.\n\n## Reference\n\n- [Rich Harris - Rethinking reactivity talk at YGLF 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao)\n","title":"Why Virtual DOM is fast?","short_title":"","description":"React and Vue, two popular front-end frameworks, both use Virtual DOM to improve page rendering efficiency.

With years of experience in the technology industry, we understand the importance of selecting the right tools and technologies to deliver exceptional results. In today's fast-paced world, staying ahead of the competition requires building and deploying features quickly without sacrificing quality or stability. When selecting a technology for our frontend tech stack, the foremost question we ask is: \"Has this technology achieved a certain level of stability and maturity?\" Quick wins are important, but truly transformative products, teams, and infrastructures require years of sustained effort. In this article, we'll discuss the key components of our tech stack and explain how they contribute to our ability to develop high-quality, scalable applications at lightning-fast speeds.\n\n## Basic building blocks\n\n![](assets/why-we-chose-our-tech-stack-accelerating-development-with-a-robust-frontend-solution_974445b14fdc44d726716ff2a1c499a0_md5.webp)\n\n### React\n\nWith a decade of evolution under its belt, **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** has proven itself as a stable, high-performance, and user-friendly frontend framework. It strikes the perfect balance of stability, performance, and usability, earning its place as our go-to choice for the frontend foundation. Although React has a steeper learning curve compared to some other frontend frameworks, its vast ecosystem, extensive documentation, and strong community support make it a worthwhile investment for long-term projects.\n\n### NextJS\n\nWhen it comes to scaling production-ready React applications, **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** is our top pick. This well-rounded framework delivers an unbeatable developer experience, complete with essential features like hybrid static and server rendering, TypeScript support, intelligent bundling, and route pre-fetching. One potential limitation of Next.js is the added complexity it introduces compared to a standard React application. However, we find that the benefits of improved performance, scalability, and developer experience more than justify this trade-off, and the Next.js community provides excellent support and resources to help developers overcome any challenges.\n\n### React Context\n\nWe don't advocate for any specific state management library. React Context API simplifies data transfer through the component tree without resorting to manual prop drilling. Most applications don't require complex global state management, and React Context is more than sufficient for tackling simpler problems. Our philosophy for React state management is to keep state as local as possible and utilize React Context when prop drilling becomes unwieldy. Some developers might consider React Context less powerful than other state management libraries like Redux or MobX, but for many projects, the simplicity and native integration of React Context prove to be advantageous. By avoiding unnecessary complexity, we can focus on delivering efficient and maintainable applications.\n\n### TypeScript\n\nIntegrating **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** into our codebase offers numerous benefits for developing medium to large-scale applications. By using TypeScript, we can identify bugs at compile-time, code with confidence through features such as auto-completion, definition jumping, and source documentation, and synchronize API interfaces between backend and frontend using Swagger JSON documentation. Furthermore, TypeScript streamlines the refactoring and renaming processes, ultimately enhancing our development workflow and the quality of the applications we deliver.\n\nWe recognize that TypeScript might initially seem daunting for developers who are more familiar with JavaScript. However, we've found that by providing comprehensive onboarding materials and ongoing support, our team can quickly adapt to TypeScript and leverage its benefits to ensure a more robust and maintainable codebase. Additionally, TypeScript's compatibility with JavaScript means that we can gradually migrate portions of our codebase, reducing the risk and impact of transitioning to a new language.\n\n### SWR\n\n**[SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)** functions as our backend data caching layer, ensuring a responsive and dynamic UI. By presenting cached data first (stale), revalidating with a fetch request, and ultimately updating with current data, our UI remains lively and up-to-date. One potential drawback of SWR is the possibility of over-fetching or under-fetching data in some scenarios, which may lead to performance issues.\n\nTo address these concerns, we fine-tune SWR configurations to optimize data fetching strategies based on the specific requirements of each application. This approach ensures optimal performance and data freshness while minimizing any potential drawbacks of SWR integration.\n\n### React Hook Forms\n\nWe endorse **[React Hook Forms](https://react-hook-form.com/)** for form management, thanks to its exceptional balance of performance and developer experience. While React Hook Forms may not be as feature-rich as some other form libraries like Formik, its focus on simplicity and performance ensures that we can create efficient and maintainable forms for most use cases. When additional functionality is needed, React Hook Forms can be easily extended with custom components or third-party libraries, providing a flexible and adaptable solution for form management.\n\n### TailwindCSS\n\n[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) resolves common CSS frustrations and accelerates development for developers of all skill levels. Key benefits include:\n\n- Consistency: utility classes adhere to system constraints, preventing arbitrary values\n- Simplified naming: no need for complex namespacing techniques like BEM\n- Lean production build: automatically removes unused CSS for optimized bundles\n- Mobile-first: apply utilities easily at specific breakpoints\n- Customization: JIT and `**tailwind.config.js**` allow extensive personalization\n\nAlthough TailwindCSS may initially appear verbose and lead to larger HTML files, the framework's automatic removal of unused CSS in production builds ensures that the final bundle remains lean and performant. Additionally, the utility-first approach quickly becomes intuitive, leading to faster development and easier maintenance.\n\n## Architecture\n\nOur frontend applications rely on a thoughtfully designed, multi-layered architecture that guarantees production-readiness and exceptional results. Each layer plays a critical role in the overall performance and scalability of the application.\n\n![](assets/why-we-chose-our-tech-stack-accelerating-development-with-a-robust-frontend-solution_1ff4c200530392d7cfd5ff04c8edb60a_md5.webp)\n\n### Service Connector: Fetch API\n\nThe service connector layer is responsible for handling communication between the frontend and backend services. We utilize the Fetch API for all our API calls. By integrating the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) with SWR, we can efficiently manage API requests, caching, and error handling. This combination ensures a fast and reactive user experience while maintaining a clean and organized codebase.\n\n### State Management: React Context and SWR\n\nIn the state management layer, React Context is used for managing local state, while SWR handles global state and caching. This combination allows us to manage state effectively at different levels of the application, ensuring that components have access to the data they need without unnecessary prop drilling. The use of React Context and SWR enables smooth data flow and seamless updates across components, resulting in a highly reactive and efficient user interface.\n\n### Logic: React Hooks\n\nThe logic layer encapsulates the application's business logic and separates it from UI components. By using React Hooks, we can create reusable and composable logic that can be easily integrated into our components. Custom hooks help abstract complex logic and manage side effects, promoting code reusability and maintainability while ensuring a clear separation of concerns. This approach allows developers to focus on specific parts of the application logic, making it easier to understand, test, and debug.\n\n### UI: TailwindCSS and HeadlessUI\n\nIn the UI layer, we combine TailwindCSS and **[HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.dev/)** to create visually appealing and accessible user interfaces. TailwindCSS streamlines the design process with utility classes, responsive design, and customization options, while HeadlessUI provides fully accessible, unstyled UI components that integrate seamlessly with TailwindCSS.\n\nIt's worth noting that while popular libraries like **[Ant Design](https://ant.design/)** and **[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)** offer comprehensive, ready-to-use UI components, they may impose constraints on design flexibility and sometimes require additional customization efforts to match the desired look and feel of an application. In contrast, TailwindCSS and HeadlessUI provide a more flexible and lightweight approach to styling and building UI components.\n\nOne potential drawback of using TailwindCSS and HeadlessUI is the need to assemble and style components from scratch, which may seem time-consuming initially. However, by investing in creating reusable and customizable components tailored to our design requirements, we ensure a more consistent and maintainable codebase. Additionally, this approach allows us to retain full control over the appearance and behavior of our components, avoiding the need to override default styles provided by pre-built component libraries.\n\n## Prioritizing Testing\n\nA critical aspect of developing robust and reliable applications is implementing thorough testing. We understand the importance of a comprehensive testing strategy that covers every aspect of our frontend applications, from unit tests to integration tests and end-to-end tests.\n\n### Jest\n\n**[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)** is our preferred testing framework for writing and running JavaScript tests. This feature-rich framework offers a straightforward setup, clear and concise error messages, and fast execution. However, Jest's performance can sometimes degrade when testing large applications with a high number of tests. To mitigate this issue, we make use of Jest's built-in support for test parallelization and selective test runs, which allow us to execute tests more efficiently and reduce overall test execution time.\n\n### React Testing Library\n\nWhen testing React components, we utilize the **[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)**. This library encourages best practices by focusing on testing components based on how they are used by the end-user, rather than testing implementation details. With React Testing Library, our tests are more resilient to changes in the codebase, reducing the maintenance burden and ensuring that our applications function as intended from a user's perspective.\n\n### Cypress\n\nFor end-to-end testing, we rely on **[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)**, a powerful and user-friendly testing framework designed specifically for modern web applications. While Cypress excels in many areas, it currently supports only the Chromium-based browsers for end-to-end testing. However, given that the majority of users utilize Chromium-based browsers, and since Cypress tests closely simulate real-world user interactions, we believe that this limitation does not significantly impact our ability to deliver high-quality applications. Cypress enables us to write reliable, easy-to-debug tests that run directly in the browser, closely simulating real-world user interactions. This allows us to identify and resolve issues that might not be caught by unit and integration tests, ensuring a seamless and bug-free user experience.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur meticulously selected frontend tech stack enables Dwarves Foundation to keep pace with the technology industry's rapid advancements and the growing demand for cutting-edge frontend solutions. By harnessing the strengths of React, Next.js, React Context, TypeScript, SWR, React Hook Forms, TailwindCSS, and HeadlessUI, we can develop high-quality, scalable applications with remarkable speed.

This communication can occur between windows and iframes with the same origin or across different origins.\n\n## Same Origin Communication\n\n\"Same origin\" refers to the scenario where two URLs have the same protocol, domain, and port. For instance, the following URLs have the same origin:\n\n- http://example.com\n- http://example.com/\n- http://example.com/my/page.html\n\nOn the other hand, these URLs do not share the same origin:\n\n- http://example.org (different domain: `.org`)\n- http://www.example.com (different subdomain: `www.`)\n- https://example.com (different protocol: `https`)\n- http://example.com:8080 (different port: `8080`)\n\nIn the case of same origin communication:\n\n- If a window comes from the same origin as an iframe, we have full access to the iframe's content, including variables and document. If they don't share the same origin, access to the content is restricted for security reasons.\n- The parent window can modify the inner window using the `contentWindow` or `contentDocument` property. Here is an example of same origin communication:\n\n```html\n\u003c!-- iframe from the same site --\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"/\" id=\"iframe\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003cscript\u003e\n  iframe.onload = function () {\n    // just do anything\n    iframe.contentDocument.body.prepend('Hello, world!')\n  }\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nUse cases for same origin communication include content builder applications where the isolation of CSS and responsive display are essential. ![](assets/window-and-iframe-communication_iframe-window-content-builder.webp)\n\n## Cross Origin Communication\n\nCross origin communication occurs when the iframe and the parent window come from different origins. The [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) interface allows windows to communicate regardless of their origins.\n\nThis method is an exception to the \"Same Origin\" policy, enabling windows from different origins to exchange information if both parties agree and implement corresponding JavaScript functions, ensuring user safety.\n\nHere's how the communication happens:\n\n- Both the iframe and its parent window can communicate using the `postMessage` method.\n- The parent window uses `iframe.contentWindow.postMessage` to send messages to the iframe.\n- The iframe sends messages to the parent window using `window.parent.postMessage`.\n- Both parties receive messages using `window.addEventListener('message')`.\n\nHere's an example of cross origin communication:\n\n```html\n\u003ciframe src=\"http://example.com\" name=\"example\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cscript\u003e\n  let iframe = window.frames.example\n  // target origin is *\n  iframe.contentWindow.postMessage('message', '*')\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\n```js\n// http://example.com internal script\nwindow.addEventListener('message', function (event) {\n  if (event.origin != 'http://source.com') {\n    // something from an unknown domain, let's ignore it\n    return\n  }\n\n  alert('received: ' + event.data)\n\n  // can message back using event.source.postMessage(...)\n  // or window.parent.postMessage(...)\n})\n```\n\nUse cases for cross origin communication include embedded widgets like chatboxes. ![](assets/window-and-iframe-communication_window-iframe-chatbox.webp)\n\nIn summary, communication between a window and an iframe is facilitated through the `postMessage` interface for cross origin scenarios, and the `contentWindow` property for same origin scenarios. This allows for seamless integration of iframes in various web applications, enhancing user experience and functionality.\n\n## References\n\n- https://javascript.info/cross-window-communication\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage\n- [Two way iframe communication](https://gist.github.com/pbojinov/8965299)\n","title":"Window and iframe communication","short_title":"","description":"When working with web development, communicating between a main window and an embedded iframe is often necessary for various tasks, such as content creation or widget implementation.

This idea was found after the founder's painful work at https://webviz.io when he had to use a bundle of manual memory management techniques such as ArrayBuffers, WebWorkers for performance optimization. Back up with the assumption that an intricate web app like Figma also uses Wasm, they thought there would be a lot of companies experiencing a similar performance issue with their applications and those companies would be keen on using their new tool to 10x speed up the apps. And yes, the story was convincing in theory but was a failure in real-world implementations. Here are their takeaways after a year working on the tool:\n\n- They took a week to port a JS simulator of one of their initial users to Rust. It was 5% faster and definitely was not a compelling result. Rust only helps with its faster linear algebra functions but the simulator was already developed with those functions optimized in JS. Rust is faster than JS in some cases, but from their continuing experiments (the previous example was one of them), those cases are rarer than they expected.\n  \u003e The performance gain is on the order of 2x some of the time, not 10x most of the time. The big 10x gains do appear when you really lean on Rust’s zero-cost abstractions — processing a million tiny Rust structs is faster than a million JS objects for reasons of memory layout and avoiding the GC — but this is a rare case.\n- They did one successfully make a migration greatly faster as their promise but quickly realized it was due to WebGL, not because of Rust or Wasm. They looked back the case of Figma and it was the same story.\n  \u003e Figma files are processed in C++/Wasm, and this is likely a huge speedup, but most of Figma’s performance magic is due to their WebGL renderer.\n\nWe might think it could be a pivot for them to move away from Rust/Wasm and approach WebGL rerender as an alternative. They did think about it but the market demand certainly doesn't look promising as they initially visioned and doubt if it's still worth a startup opportunity.\n\n#### Reference\n\n- https://zaplib.com/docs/blog_post_mortem.html\n- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30960509\n","title":"Zaplib post-mortem","short_title":"","description":"Zaplib is a frontend framework that helps to port your JS/TS app to Rust/Wasm.
