id=\"preamble\"\u003ePreamble\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we look around in the world at large, what you see is a lot of independently executing things like there's people doing their own things out side, there's cars going by, all of those things are independent agents in side the world. If you think about writting a computer program, if you want to simulate or interact with that environment, a single sequential execution is not a very good approach. So concurrency is really a way of writting or structuring your program to deal with the real world, may be simulate the real world or behave as an agent inisde the real world and be a good actor in that environment. By definition, concurrency is defined as the composition of independently executing computations. First of all, I want to stress that concurrency is not parallelism, but today we're not going to talk about this, if you interest, please let me know and I will write one about this topic later on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"unexpected-go-concurrency-pitfalls\"\u003eUnexpected Go concurrency pitfalls\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith concurrency primitives built-in to the language. By using the \u003ccode\u003ego\u003c/code\u003e keyword to create goroutines, and by using channels together with other concurrency synchronization techniques provided in Go, concurrent programming become easy, flexible, enjoyable. On the other hand, Go doesn't prevent programmers from making some concurrent programming mistakes which are caused by either carelessness or lacking of experience. Below is some unexpected pitfalls when using the concurrency features provided by the Go programming language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"no-synchronizations-when-synchronizations-are-needed\"\u003eNo Synchronizations When Synchronizations Are Needed\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTake-away\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"https://go101.org/article/memory-model.html\"\u003eCode lines might be not executed by their appearance order.\u003c/a\u003e\nThere are 2 mistakes in the following program. - First, the read of \u003ccode\u003eb\u003c/code\u003e in the main goroutine and the write of \u003ccode\u003eb\u003c/code\u003e in the new goroutine might cause data races. - Second, the condition \u003ccode\u003eb == true\u003c/code\u003e can't ensure that \u003ccode\u003ea != nil\u003c/code\u003e in the main goroutine. Compilers and CPUs may make optimizations by reordering instructions in the new goroutine, so the assignment of \u003ccode\u003eb\u003c/code\u003e may happen before the assignment of \u003ccode\u003ea\u003c/code\u003e at run time, which makes that slice \u003ccode\u003ea\u003c/code\u003e is still \u003ccode\u003enil\u003c/code\u003e when the elements of \u003ccode\u003ea\u003c/code\u003e are modified in the main goroutine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"hljs language-go\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003epackage\u003c/span\u003e main\n\n\u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003eimport\u003c/span\u003e (\n\t\u003cspan class=\"hljs-string\"\u003e\"time\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\u003cspan class=\"hljs-string\"\u003e\"runtime\"\u003c/span\u003e\n)\n\n\u003cspan class=\"hljs-function\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003efunc\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"hljs-title\"\u003emain\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"hljs-params\"\u003e()\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e {\n\t\u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003evar\u003c/span\u003e a []\u003cspan class=\"hljs-type\"\u003eint\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"hljs-comment\"\u003e// nil\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003evar\u003c/span\u003e b \u003cspan class=\"hljs-type\"\u003ebool\u003c/span\u003e  \u003cspan class=\"hljs-comment\"\u003e// false\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\t\u003cspan class=\"hljs-comment\"\u003e// a new goroutine\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003ego\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"hljs-function\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003efunc\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"hljs-params\"\u003e()\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e {\n\t\ta = \u003cspan class=\"hljs-built_in\"\u003emake\u003c/span\u003e([]\u003cspan class=\"hljs-type\"\u003eint\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"hljs-number\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e)\n\t\tb = \u003cspan class=\"hljs-literal\"\u003etrue\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"hljs-comment\"\u003e// write b\u003c/span\u003e\n\t}()\n\n\t\u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003efor\u003c/span\u003e !b { \u003cspan class=\"hljs-comment\"\u003e// read b\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\ttime.Sleep(time.Second)\n\t\truntime.Gosched()\n\t}\n\ta[\u003cspan class=\"hljs-number\"\u003e0\u003c/span\u003e], a[\u003cspan class=\"hljs-number\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e], a[\u003cspan class=\"hljs-number\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e] = \u003cspan class=\"hljs-number\"\u003e0\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"hljs-number\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"hljs-number\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"hljs-comment\"\u003e// might panic\u003c/span\u003e\n}\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe above program may run well on one computer, but may panic on another one, or it runs well when it is compiled by one compiler, but panics when another compiler is used.\nWe should use channels or the synchronization techniques provided in the \u003ccode\u003esync\u003c/code\u003e standard package to ensure the memory orders.

Some explanations: - The \u003ccode\u003eStop\u003c/code\u003e method of a \u003ccode\u003e*Timer\u003c/code\u003e value returns \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e if the corresponding \u003ccode\u003eTimer\u003c/code\u003e value has already expired or been stopped.

This is the meaningfulness of the \u003ccode\u003eif\u003c/code\u003e code block in the example in the last section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003eReset\u003c/code\u003e method of a \u003ccode\u003e*Timer\u003c/code\u003e value must be called when the corresponding \u003ccode\u003eTimer\u003c/code\u003e value has already expired or been stopped, otherwise, a data race may occur between the \u003ccode\u003eReset\u003c/code\u003e call and a possible notification send to the \u003ccode\u003eC\u003c/code\u003e channel field of the \u003ccode\u003eTimer\u003c/code\u003e value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the first \u003ccode\u003ecase\u003c/code\u003e branch of the \u003ccode\u003eselect\u003c/code\u003e block is selected, it means the \u003ccode\u003eTimer\u003c/code\u003e value has already expired, so we don't need to stop it, for the sent notification has already been taken out. However, we must stop the timer in the second branch to check whether or not a timeout notification exists. If it does exist, we should drain it before reusing the timer, otherwise, the notification will be fired immediately in the next loop step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, the following program is very possible to exit in about one second, instead of ten seconds.
