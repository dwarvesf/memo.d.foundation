concurrently (perhaps in parallel if the program is run on a machine with multiple physical cores, GOMAXPROCS are automatically set to the number of physical cores of the machine that the program is running on)\n\nWhile the Go concurrency primitives are easy to work with (it means it's easy to create the Go concurrency primitives and start using them), but they don't prevent us the developers to write something incorrectly or buggy. They should be used with great care and ideally they should be combined together to achieve some concurrency patterns to be fit in different use cases or contexts where we might solve/handle our problems/business concurrently.\n## Introduction\n\nConcurrency patterns in Go are different ways to put Go’s concurrency primitives together to build interesting structures and get our code to respond well to a lot of things happening at once. Below are four popular concurrency patterns in Go that helps handle large amount of workloads concurrently in a safe and elegant way.\n\nThis post will explain these patterns with a simple example and walk you through the code as well as the decision-making when writing these codes.\n\n## The Patterns\n\n## The Workers Pool pattern\n\n## The Patterns\n\n```go\n\n// worker simply double the number received from the jobs channel and send it to the results channel\nfunc worker(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup, jobs \u003c-chan int, results chan\u003c- int) {\n\tdefer wg.Done()\n\tfor j := range jobs {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"worker\", id, \"processing job\", j)\n\t\tresults \u003c- j * 2\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tconst (\n\t\tnumJobs, numWorkers = 5, 3\n\t)\n\tvar (\n\t\tjobs     = make(chan int, numJobs)\n\t\tresults  = make(chan int, numJobs)\n\t\tworkerWg = new(sync.WaitGroup)\n\t)\n\tworkerWg.Add(numWorkers)\n\n\t// Create a pool of 3 workers\n\tfor w := 1; w \u003c= numWorkers; w++ {\n\t\tgo worker(w, workerWg, jobs, results)\n\t}\n\n\tgo func() {\n\t\tdefer close(results)\n\t\tworkerWg.Wait()\n\t}()\n\n\t// Add jobs to the queue\n\tgo func() {\n\t\tdefer close(jobs)\n\t\tfor j := 1; j \u003c= numJobs; j++ {\n\t\t\tjobs \u003c- j\n\t\t}\n\t}()\n\n\t// Collect results from the workers\n\tfor res := range results {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"RESULT:\", res)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### The disadvantages of this pattern\n\n**Limited scalability** The worker pool pattern, with a fixed number of workers, can be limited in terms of scalability. If the workload increases beyond the capacity of the worker pool, performance may suffer. One solution to this problem is to use a **dynamic worker pool**. In a dynamic worker pool, the number of workers varies based on the workload. When there are more tasks to be processed, the pool increases the number of workers, and when the workload decreases, it reduces the number of workers.\n\nTo implement a dynamic worker pool, we can use a combination of channels and goroutines. We can create a channel to receive tasks and another channel to send results. We can also create a goroutine that listens to the task channel and assigns tasks to available workers. Each worker is a goroutine that receives a task from the worker channel, processes it, and sends the result back to the result channel. To dynamically adjust the number of workers, we can use a separate goroutine that monitors the workload and adjusts the number of workers accordingly. By using a dynamic worker pool, we can achieve better scalability and utilization of resources. However, it requires careful tuning of parameters such as the workload threshold and the rate of worker creation/destruction to avoid overloading the system or creating too many unnecessary goroutines.\n**Limited scalability** The worker pool pattern, with a fixed number of workers, can be limited in terms of scalability.

In a dynamic worker pool, the number of workers varies based on the workload. When there are more tasks to be processed, the pool increases the number of workers, and when the workload decreases, it reduces the number of workers.\n\n**Task prioritization** The worker pool pattern does not provide a built-in mechanism for task prioritization. This means that all tasks are treated equally, regardless of their importance or urgency. We can introduce a **priority queue** data structure to the workers pool pattern. A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements with associated priorities and allows for efficient retrieval of the element with the highest priority.\n\n**Resource management** Managing resources such as memory and CPU usage can be challenging with the worker pool pattern. Since the number of workers is fixed, it can be difficult to optimize resource usage for different types of workloads. If a worker takes too long to complete a task, we can **use a timeout mechanism for tasks**, such that the task can be timed out and reassigned to another worker. This ensures that no worker is blocked for an extended period of time and helps maintain the overall performance of the system.\nFan-out/fan-in is a pattern for parallelizing work across multiple goroutines. The idea is to split the work into smaller chunks and distribute them across a pool of workers. Once all the workers have finished processing their chunks, the results are collected and combined.\n**Task prioritization** The worker pool pattern does not provide a built-in mechanism for task prioritization. This means that all tasks are treated equally, regardless of their importance or urgency. We can introduce a **priority queue** data structure to the workers pool pattern. A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements with associated priorities and allows for efficient retrieval of the element with the highest priority.\n\nThe `fan-out` part of the pattern involves distributing work among multiple worker goroutines. These goroutines work concurrently, each handling a portion of the tasks. This approach helps to increase throughput and process large datasets more efficiently. The `fan-in` aspect of the pattern involves collecting the results from the worker goroutines and combining them into a single output. This process is typically done using a dedicated goroutine that listens to the individual output channels of the workers, merges the results, and sends them to a single output channel.\n\n\nThe fan-out, fan-in pattern is particularly useful in situations where tasks can be divided into smaller, independent units and processed concurrently. This pattern not only improves application performance but also enhances code maintainability and readability by separating the concerns of distributing tasks and aggregating results.\n\n```go\n// simulateDownload simulates downloading a file and returns its content.\nfunc simulateDownload(url string) string {\n\ttime.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(100)) * time.Millisecond)\n\treturn fmt.Sprintf(\"Content of %s\", url)\n}\n\n// downloader downloads a list of URLs and returns the content.\nfunc downloader(urls []string) \u003c-chan string {\n\tout := make(chan string)\n\tgo func() {\n\t\tdefer close(out)\n\t\tfor _, url := range urls {\n\t\t\tout \u003c- simulateDownload(url)\n\t\t}\n\t}()\n\treturn out\n}\n\n// worker processes the content and returns the number of words.\nfunc worker(in \u003c-chan string) \u003c-chan int {\n\tout := make(chan int)\n\tgo func() {\n\t\tdefer close(out)\n\t\tfor content := range in {\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(time.Now().Format(\"2006-01-02 15:04:05.000000000 -0700 MST\"))\n\t\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Processing content: %s\\\\n\", content)\n\t\t\twords := strings.Fields(content)\n\t\t\tout \u003c- len(words)\n\t\t}\n\t}()\n\treturn out\n}\n\n// merger merges the results from multiple workers.\nfunc merger(ins ...\u003c-chan int) \u003c-chan int {\n\tout := make(chan int)\n\tvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\twg.Add(len(ins))\n\n\tfor _, in := range ins {\n\t\tgo func(in \u003c-chan int) {\n\t\t\tdefer wg.Done()\n\t\t\tfor n := range in {\n\t\t\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Merging result: %d\\\\n\\\\n\", n)\n\t\t\t\tout \u003c- n\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}(in)\n\t}\n\n\tgo func() {\n\t\tdefer close(out)\n\t\twg.Wait()\n\t}()\n\n\treturn out\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\trand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())\n\n\turls := []string{\n\t\t\"\u003chttps://example.com/file1.txt\u003e\",\n\t\t\"\u003chttps://example.com/file2.txt\u003e\",\n\t\t\"\u003chttps://example.com/file3.txt\u003e\",\n\t\t\"\u003chttps://example.com/file4.txt\u003e\",\n\t\t\"\u003chttps://example.com/file5.txt\u003e\",\n\t}\n\n\tdownloadStream := downloader(urls)\n\tnumWorkers := 3\n\n\tworkerChannels := make([]\u003c-chan int, numWorkers)\n\tfor i := 0; i \u003c numWorkers; i++ {\n\t\tworkerChannels[i] = worker(downloadStream)\n\t}\n\n\tmerged := merger(workerChannels...)\n\n\ttotalWordCount := 0\n\tfor count := range merged {\n\t\ttotalWordCount += count\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Total word count: %d\\\\n\", totalWordCount)\n}\n```\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. Import necessary packages.\n2. Define `simulateDownload(url string)` function, which simulates downloading a file from the provided URL and returns its content as a string.\n3. Define `downloader(urls []string)` function, which takes a slice of URLs and returns a channel that sends the content of each URL. It launches a goroutine that iterates over the URLs, simulates the download, and sends the content through the channel. The channel is closed after all URLs have been processed. *It will be* **_fan-out part_**: the\\* `downloader` function creates a single `downloadStream` channel that sends the content of each downloaded file. Later, we will create multiple worker goroutines that listen to this shared channel, effectively fanning out the work to be done concurrently.\n4. Define `worker(in \u003c-chan string)` function, which takes a channel of strings as input and returns a channel of integers. It launches a goroutine that reads the content from the input channel, prints the processing timestamp and content, counts the number of words in the content, and sends the count through the output channel. The output channel is closed after all content has been processed.\n5. Define `merger(ins ...\u003c-chan int)` function, which takes a variadic parameter of channels with integer values and returns a channel with integer values. It merges the input channels into a single output channel. A `sync.WaitGroup` is used to wait for all input channels to be processed, after which the output channel is closed. *It will be* **_fan-in part_**: the\\* `merger` function combines the results from multiple worker goroutines by listening to their individual output channels. It uses a `sync.WaitGroup` to ensure that it waits for all the worker goroutines to complete before closing its output channel.\n6. In the `main` function, seed the random generator, define a slice of URLs, and create a download stream by calling the `downloader()` function.\n2. Define `simulateDownload(url string)` function, which simulates downloading a file from the provided URL and returns its content as a string.\n3. Define `downloader(urls []string)` function, which takes a slice of URLs and returns a channel that sends the content of each URL. It launches a goroutine that iterates over the URLs, simulates the download, and sends the content through the channel. The channel is closed after all URLs have been processed. *It will be* **_fan-out part_**: the\\* `downloader` function creates a single `downloadStream` channel that sends the content of each downloaded file. Later, we will create multiple worker goroutines that listen to this shared channel, effectively fanning out the work to be done concurrently.\n4. Define `worker(in \u003c-chan string)` function, which takes a channel of strings as input and returns a channel of integers. It launches a goroutine that reads the content from the input channel, prints the processing timestamp and content, counts the number of words in the content, and sends the count through the output channel. The output channel is closed after all content has been processed.\n5.

Iterate over the merged channel to compute the total word count.\n10. Print the total word count.\n**Resource consumption** Creating too many goroutines can lead to excessive resource consumption, which can cause performance issues or even crashes. This is particularly true if the sub-tasks are short-lived and the overhead of creating and managing goroutines outweighs the benefits. To avoid excessive resource consumption, you can **limit the number of goroutines** that are created at any given time. One way to do this is to use a worker pool, where a fixed number of goroutines are created upfront and then used to process tasks as they become available.\n\n\n**Increased complexity** The fan-out/fan-in pattern can add complexity to your code, especially if you need to handle errors or timeouts. It can also make it harder to reason about the behavior of your program. To handle errors or timeouts, you can use the **context cancellation**, or use the context package to propagate cancellation signals to all the goroutines involved in the fan-out/fan-in pattern. This can help ensure that resources are released promptly and that your program doesn't hang indefinitely.\n\n**Resource consumption** Creating too many goroutines can lead to excessive resource consumption, which can cause performance issues or even crashes.

If possible, try to design your program so that synchronization is only necessary when aggregating the results of the sub-tasks to **avoid unnecessary synchronization**. For example, you can use channels to pass data between goroutines instead of shared memory, which can reduce the likelihood of race conditions or deadlocks.\n\tmultiply(add(input, 1), 2)\n\n\n\t// Example 2:\n\t// We can rearrange the stages to get diff result\n\tadd(multiply(input, 2), 1)\n}\n\nfunc add(x int, y int) int {\n\treturn x + y\n}\n\nfunc multiply(x int, y int) int {\n\treturn x * y\n}\n```\n\n### The benefit of a pipeline is evident\n\n- It separates the concerns of each stage in the pipeline. Each stage is responsible for one and only one thing.\n- The stages are modular and allow us to mix and match how stages are combined. The stages in the example above run sequentially. Each can only begin after the previous stage has processed all the data. Leveraging the Goroutine and channel, stages can run and process data concurrently. First, we transform our `add` and `multiply`function to take in an `inputCh` and outputs a `resultCh`.\n\n```go\nfunc generator(doneCh chan struct{}, input []int) chan int {\n\tinputCh := make(chan int)\n\n### The benefit of a pipeline is evident\n\n- It separates the concerns of each stage in the pipeline.

We create a data stream using the `generator` function\n2. We create a `doneCh` and pass to all Goroutines for explicit cancellation\n3. We then chain the `add` and `multiply` stage together\n4. Whenever the `add` function has done processing an input. It will immediately pass the result to the multiply stage for further processing\n\nEach stage processes the data concurrently and immediately passes it to the next stage once it’s done. Moreover, the multiply and the add stage can be mixed and matched to produce different results.\n\n### The disadvantages of this pattern\n\n**Increased complexity** The pipeline pattern can become complex when dealing with multiple stages and channels. This complexity can make it difficult to debug and maintain the code. To reduce the complexity of the pipeline pattern, it is important to keep each stage simple and focused on a specific task. This will make it easier to debug and maintain the code.\n\n**Blocking** If one stage of the pipeline is blocked, it can cause the entire pipeline to block. This can lead to performance issues and slow down the processing of data. To avoid blocking in the pipeline, non-blocking channels can be used. This will allow the pipeline to continue processing data even if one stage is blocked.\n2. We create a `doneCh` and pass to all Goroutines for explicit cancellation\n3. We then chain the `add` and `multiply` stage together\n4. Whenever the `add` function has done processing an input. It will immediately pass the result to the multiply stage for further processing\nProper error handling should be implemented in each stage of the pipeline to handle any errors that may occur. This will help to prevent the pipeline from crashing and losing data.\n\n## The Semaphore pattern\n\n\n**Increased complexity** The pipeline pattern can become complex when dealing with multiple stages and channels. This complexity can make it difficult to debug and maintain the code. To reduce the complexity of the pipeline pattern, it is important to keep each stage simple and focused on a specific task. This will make it easier to debug and maintain the code.\n\n**Blocking** If one stage of the pipeline is blocked, it can cause the entire pipeline to block. This can lead to performance issues and slow down the processing of data. To avoid blocking in the pipeline, non-blocking channels can be used. This will allow the pipeline to continue processing data even if one stage is blocked.\ntype Semaphore struct {\n**Data Loss** If the pipeline is not designed properly, it can result in data loss. For example, if a channel is not buffered and a stage is not ready to receive data, the data will be lost. To prevent data loss, buffered channels can be used. This will ensure that data is not lost if a stage is not ready to receive data.\nfunc NewSemaphore(maxReq int) *Semaphore {\n\treturn \u0026Semaphore{\n\t\tsemaCh: make(chan struct{}, maxReq),\n\t}\n\n![](assets/approaches-to-manage-concurrent-workloads-like-worker-pools-and-pipelines_6cff9e49452d4333171fa27c6f77cf90_md5.webp)\n\nfunc (s *Semaphore) Acquire() {\n\ts.semaCh \u003c- struct{}{}\n}\n\nfunc (s *Semaphore) Release() {\n\t\u003c-s.semaCh\n}\n```\n\n1. The `NewSemaphore` initiates a `Semaphore` by creating a buffered channel with the capacity of `maxReq`\n2. When a Goroutine `Acquire` a semaphore, we send an empty struct to `semaCh`\n3. When the buffered channel is full, call to `Acquire` will be blocked\n4. When a Goroutine `Release` a semaphore, an empty struct will be sent out of the channel, creating space in the buffered channel for subsequent `Acquire`\n\nLet’s take a look at an example:\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n\tvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\tsemaphore := NewSemaphore(2)\n\n\tfor idx := 0; idx \u003c 10; idx++ {\n\t\twg.Add(1)\n\n\t\tgo func(taskID int) {\n2. When a Goroutine `Acquire` a semaphore, we send an empty struct to `semaCh`\n3. When the buffered channel is full, call to `Acquire` will be blocked\n4. When a Goroutine `Release` a semaphore, an empty struct will be sent out of the channel, creating space in the buffered channel for subsequent `Acquire`\n\t\t\tdefer semaphore.Release()\n\n\t\t\tmsg := fmt.Sprintf(\n\t\t\t\t\"%s Running worker %d\",\n\t\t\t\ttime.Now().Format(\"15:04:05\"),\n\t\t\t\ttaskID,\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(msg)\n\n\t\t\ttime.Sleep(1 * time.Second)\n\t\t}(idx)\n\t}\n\n\twg.Wait()\n}\n```\n\n1. We create a semaphore with the capacity of `2`\n2. We spawn ten Goroutines to process certain task\n3. Each Goroutine acquires a semaphore before processing\n4. Since there are ten tasks and the maximum number of concurrent tasks is `2`, the total time needed to process all tasks will be five seconds (Each task takes one second)\n\n### The disadvantages of this pattern\n\n**Deadlocks** One of the main disadvantages of the Semaphore pattern is the potential for deadlocks. Deadlocks occur when two or more processes are waiting for each other to release a resource, resulting in a deadlock situation where none of the processes can proceed. To avoid deadlocks, it is important to ensure that all resources are released after they have been used. In Golang, this can be achieved by using the `defer`statement to ensure that resources are always released, even if an error occurs.\n\n**Starvation** Another disadvantage of the Semaphore pattern is the potential for starvation. Starvation occurs when a process is unable to access a shared resource because other processes are constantly accessing it.\n\nTo avoid starvation, it is important to implement a fair scheduling algorithm that ensures that all processes have equal access to the shared resource. In Golang, this can be achieved by using a `sync.Mutex` to lock the shared resource and a `sync.Cond` to signal when the resource is available.\n\n**Performance Overhead** The Semaphore pattern can also introduce performance overhead due to the additional synchronization mechanisms required to control access to the shared resource. To minimize performance overhead, it is important to use the Semaphore pattern only when necessary and to carefully consider the number of resources that need to be shared. In Golang, this can be achieved by using buffered channels to limit the number of goroutines that can access the shared resource at any given time.\n\n## Considering the number of goroutines\n2. We spawn ten Goroutines to process certain task\n3. Each Goroutine acquires a semaphore before processing\n4. Since there are ten tasks and the maximum number of concurrent tasks is `2`, the total time needed to process all tasks will be five seconds (Each task takes one second)\nThe operating system schedules threads to run against available processors and the Go runtime schedules goroutines to run within a **[logical processor](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2015/02/scheduler-tracing-in-go.html)** that is bound to a single operating system thread. By default, the Go runtime allocates a single logical processor to execute all the goroutines that are created for our program. Even with this single logical processor and operating system thread, hundreds of thousands of goroutines can be scheduled to run concurrently with amazing efficiency and performance. It is not recommended to add more that one logical processor, but if you want to run goroutines in parallel, Go provides the ability to add more via the GOMAXPROCS environment variable or runtime function.\n\n\n**Deadlocks** One of the main disadvantages of the Semaphore pattern is the potential for deadlocks. Deadlocks occur when two or more processes are waiting for each other to release a resource, resulting in a deadlock situation where none of the processes can proceed. To avoid deadlocks, it is important to ensure that all resources are released after they have been used. In Golang, this can be achieved by using the `defer`statement to ensure that resources are always released, even if an error occurs.\n\n**Starvation** Another disadvantage of the Semaphore pattern is the potential for starvation. Starvation occurs when a process is unable to access a shared resource because other processes are constantly accessing it.\n- Windows: The default limit is often set to a very high value (e.g. 16 million), but it can be increased or decreased using the `SetProcessHandleCount` function.\n\nIt's important to note that increasing the file descriptor limit can have performance implications, as each open file consumes system resources. Therefore, it's generally recommended to only increase the limit if your application requires it and to monitor resource usage carefully.\n**Performance Overhead** The Semaphore pattern can also introduce performance overhead due to the additional synchronization mechanisms required to control access to the shared resource. To minimize performance overhead, it is important to use the Semaphore pattern only when necessary and to carefully consider the number of resources that need to be shared. In Golang, this can be achieved by using buffered channels to limit the number of goroutines that can access the shared resource at any given time.\n\n- When multiple goroutines are running on a single thread (logical processor), the operating system has to perform context switching between them. Context switching is the process of saving the current state of a running process or thread and restoring the saved state of another process or thread so that it can continue execution from where it left off.\n\n- The overhead of context switching between goroutines depends on several factors, including the number of goroutines running on the thread, the frequency of context switches, and the complexity of the tasks being performed by the goroutines.\n- If there are many goroutines running on a single thread, the frequency of context switches will be high, which can lead to increased overhead. This is because each time a context switch occurs, the operating system has to save the state of the currently running goroutine and restore the state of the next goroutine to be executed. This involves copying data between memory locations, which can be time-consuming.\n- In addition, if the tasks being performed by the goroutines are complex and require a lot of CPU time, the overhead of context switching can be even higher. This is because each time a context switch occurs, the CPU has to spend time re-loading its caches with the data needed by the new goroutine, which can take longer if the data is not already in the cache.\n- To minimize the overhead of context switching between goroutines, it is important to carefully manage the number of goroutines running on a single thread and to ensure that they are performing tasks that are well-suited to concurrent execution. This can involve using techniques such as load balancing and task prioritization to ensure that the most important tasks are executed first and that the workload is evenly distributed across all available threads.\n\n4. **Design Considerations:** When designing an application that uses a large number of goroutines, it's important to consider the overall architecture and ensure that it is scalable and maintainable. This may involve breaking up tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces or using a distributed system architecture.\n\n- Use channels for communication: Goroutines communicate with each other using channels. Using channels instead of shared memory avoids race conditions and makes it easier to reason about your code.\n- The typical file descriptor limits of machines nowadays vary depending on the operating system and its configuration. Here are some examples:\n- Linux: The default limit is often set to 1024, but it can be increased by modifying the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file or using the `ulimit` command. Some distributions may have higher default limits.\n- macOS: The default limit is often set to 256, but it can be increased by modifying the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file or using the `ulimit` command.\n- Windows: The default limit is often set to a very high value (e.g. 16 million), but it can be increased or decreased using the `SetProcessHandleCount` function.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n2. **Deadlocks and Race Conditions:** When multiple goroutines access shared resources concurrently, it can lead to deadlocks and race conditions. These issues can be difficult to debug and fix, especially when dealing with a large number of goroutines.\n3. **Resource Limitations:** Running a large number of goroutines can also lead to resource limitations, such as running out of memory or hitting file descriptor limits. It's important to monitor resource usage and adjust the number of goroutines accordingly.\n- When multiple goroutines are running on a single thread (logical processor), the operating system has to perform context switching between them.

Using channels instead of shared memory avoids race conditions and makes it easier to reason about your code.\n- Be mindful of blocking operations: If a goroutine blocks on an I/O operation, it will be paused and another goroutine will be scheduled to run. This can lead to inefficient use of resources if there are many goroutines waiting on I/O. Consider using non-blocking I/O or asynchronous I/O to avoid this issue.\n- Keep critical sections short: When multiple goroutines access shared data, it's important to keep critical sections short to minimize the risk of race conditions. Consider using locks or other synchronization primitives to protect shared data.\n","title":"Approaches To Manage Concurrent Workloads Like Worker Pools And Pipelines","short_title":"","description":"Explore efficient techniques for handling concurrent workloads in Go, including worker pools, fan-out/fan-in patterns, pipelines, and semaphores.

What is Finite Automata? (A Simple Explanation)\n\nFinite Automata (FA), also known as Finite State Machines, are abstract computational models used to recognize patterns or process sequences of symbols. They consist of:\n\n- A finite set of states\n- A set of input symbols (alphabet)\n- Transitions between states based on input symbols\n- An initial state\n- A set of final (accepting) states\n\nFAs can be deterministic (DFA) or nondeterministic (NFA). In a DFA, each state has exactly one transition for each input symbol, while in an NFA, a state can have multiple transitions for the same input symbol or even transitions without consuming any input (epsilon transitions).\n\nFAs are widely used in text processing, pattern matching, and lexical analysis in compilers. They efficiently recognize regular languages, making them suitable for tasks like validating email addresses or searching for specific patterns in text.\n\n## 2. What is Computing the Union of Two Finite Automata?\n\nComputing the union of two finite automata means creating a new automaton that accepts all strings accepted by either of the original automata. In other words, if we have two FAs, A and B, their union FA will accept a string if it's accepted by either A or B (or both).\n\nTheoretically, this is done by:\n\n- Creating a new start state\n- Adding epsilon transitions from this new start state to the start states of both input automata\n- Combining all states and transitions from both automata\n- Making all final states from both automata final in the new automaton\n\nThis process essentially creates an NFA that represents the union of the languages recognized by the two input automata.\n\n## 3. What is Different Between the Academic Approach and Practical Approach?\n\nThe academic approach to computing the union of finite automata, as described above, is straightforward but can be inefficient in practice. The main differences are:\n\n**Academic Approach**:\n\n- Creates a new start state and adds epsilon transitions\n- Combines all states from both automata\n- Results in an NFA that may need further processing (e.g., determinization) for efficient matching\n\n**Practical Approach**:\n\n- Avoids creating unnecessary states\n- Focuses on reachable states only\n- Aims to create a more efficient structure for actual pattern matching\n- May produce a hybrid automaton that's neither fully deterministic nor fully nondeterministic\n- Optimizes for memory usage and matching speed in real-world scenarios\n\nThe practical approach, as implemented in Quamina, tries to balance theoretical correctness with performance considerations for large-scale pattern matching.\n\n## 4. How Do We Solve This Using Golang Code?\n\nThe Quamina library implements the union of finite automata using a practical approach in the `mergeFAStates` function. Here's a detailed explanation of the implementation:\n\n```go\nfunc mergeFAStates(state1, state2 *faState, keyMemo map[faStepKey]*faState, printer printer) *faState {\n    // Memoization to avoid redundant computations\n    mKey := faStepKey{state1, state2}\n    combined, ok := keyMemo[mKey]\n    if ok {\n        return combined\n    }\n\n    // Combine field transitions\n    fieldTransitions := append(state1.fieldTransitions, state2.fieldTransitions...)\n    combined = \u0026faState{table: newSmallTable(), fieldTransitions: fieldTransitions}\n\n    // Memoize the result\n    keyMemo[mKey] = combined\n\n    // Unpack the transition tables\n    u1 := unpackTable(state1.table)\n    u2 := unpackTable(state2.table)\n    var uComb unpackedTable\n\n    // Merge transitions\n    for i, next1 := range u1 {\n        next2 := u2[i]\n        switch {\n        case next1 == next2:\n            uComb[i] = next1\n        case next2 == nil:\n            uComb[i] = next1\n        case next1 == nil:\n            uComb[i] = next2\n        case i \u003e 0 \u0026\u0026 next1 == u1[i-1] \u0026\u0026 next2 == u2[i-1]:\n            uComb[i] = uComb[i-1]\n        default:\n            var comboNext []*faState\n            for _, nextStep1 := range next1.states {\n                for _, nextStep2 := range next2.states {\n                    comboNext = append(comboNext, mergeFAStates(nextStep1, nextStep2, keyMemo, printer))\n                }\n            }\n            uComb[i] = \u0026faNext{states: comboNext}\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Pack the combined table\n    combined.table.pack(\u0026uComb)\n\n    // Combine epsilon transitions\n    combined.table.epsilon = append(state1.table.epsilon, state2.table.epsilon...)\n\n    return combined\n}\n```\n\n## Key Aspects of This Implementation:\n\n1. **Memoization**: The function uses a `keyMemo` map to store already computed merged states, avoiding redundant computations and potential infinite recursion.\n2. **Combining Field Transitions**: The field transitions from both input states are combined immediately.\n3. **Table Unpacking**: The transition tables of both input states are unpacked into a more manageable format for merging.\n4. **Merging Transitions**: The function iterates through all possible transitions (0-255 for byte values) and merges them according to several rules:\n   - If both transitions are the same, use that transition.\n   - If one transition is `nil`, use the non-`nil` transition.\n   - If the transition is the same as the previous byte value, reuse the previous merged result.\n   - For different non-`nil` transitions, recursively merge the next states.\n5. **Packing the Combined Table**: After merging, the combined table is packed back into the efficient `smallTable` format.\n6. **Combining Epsilon Transitions**: Epsilon transitions from both input states are combined.\n\n## Advantages:\n\n- Avoids creating unnecessary states by only merging reachable states.\n- Handles both deterministic and nondeterministic aspects of the input automata.\n- The memoization technique prevents redundant computations, improving efficiency for large automata.\n- The use of the `smallTable` structure keeps the memory footprint low.\n- By merging transitions byte-by-byte, it maintains compatibility with UTF-8 encoded input.\n\n## Trade-offs:\n\n- The resulting automaton may not be minimal or fully deterministic.\n- The recursive nature of the function could lead to stack overflow for extremely large or complex automata.\n- Performance depends on the structure of the input automata and can vary significantly based on their complexity.\n\nIn practice, this implementation provides a good balance between theoretical correctness and practical efficiency for the pattern matching tasks Quamina is designed to handle. It allows for the combination of multiple patterns into a single automaton structure that can be efficiently traversed during the matching process.\n","title":"Efficient Union of Finite Automata in Golang: A Practical Approach","short_title":"","description":"An in-depth guide on implementing the union of finite automata in Golang, focusing on practical efficiency and performance considerations.","tags":["golang","finite-automata","pattern-matching","state-machines"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["minhlq"],"date":"Thu Sep 05 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/go/compute-union-2-finite-automata.md","slugArray":["playground","go","compute-union-2-finite-automata"]},{"content":"\n## An introduction to Vim and how to use Vim with Golang\n\n- Vim is a powerful text-editor, usually used server environments with no graphical interfaces. In this post, I will layer a basic foundation of Vim and show you how to use Vim as an IDE for Go.\n\n## What is Vim\n\nVim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing, the next version of Vi (Vim = Vi Improved), written by Bram Moolenaar, first released in 1991.\n\n- Vim is often called a \"programmer's editor,\"\n- Vim can be used as IDE for its plugins.\n- Vim can support for many platforms.\n\n## Install and Config\n\n- Vim can be downloaded at [vim homepage](https://www.vim.org/download.php) or set up by [brew](https://brew.sh/)\n\n`brew install vim`\n\n- Since some plugins can be in needed of lua, you should set up with this command line`brew install vim --with-lua`\n- After finished setting, create a.vimrc file. This file is where you store every config, plugins or bundle, as well as other Vim related function.\n- Next, set up vim plugins manager. Currently, I’m using [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), you can use [panthogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) if you like. Vundle will help in config those plugins in .vimrc, install or update and other tasks. In order to set up, clone vundle in the folder ~/.vim/bundle/ (folder .vim will appear when you finish installed vim)`git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`\n\nCopy some configs and basic plugins into .vimrc (please note that the “ in vim is comment)\n\n```javascript\nset nocompatible              \" be iMproved, required\nfiletype off                  \" required\n\n\" set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize\nset rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim\ncall vundle#begin()\n\" alternatively, pass a path where Vundle should install plugins\n\"call vundle#begin('~/some/path/here')\n\n\" let Vundle manage Vundle, required\nPlugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'\n\n\" The following are examples of different formats supported.\n\" Keep Plugin commands between vundle#begin/end.\n\" plugin on GitHub repo\nPlugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'\n\" plugin from http://vim-scripts.org/vim/scripts.html\nPlugin 'L9'\n\" Git plugin not hosted on GitHub\nPlugin 'git://git.wincent.com/command-t.git'\n\" git repos on your local machine (i.e. when working on your own plugin)\nPlugin 'file:///home/gmarik/path/to/plugin'\n\" The sparkup vim script is in a subdirectory of this repo called vim.\n\" Pass the path to set the runtimepath properly.\nPlugin 'rstacruz/sparkup', {'rtp': 'vim/'}\n\" Avoid a name conflict with L9\nPlugin 'user/L9', {'name': 'newL9'}\n\n\" All of your Plugins must be added before the following line\ncall vundle#end()            \" required\nfiletype plugin indent on    \" required\n\" To ignore plugin indent changes, instead use:\n\"filetype plugin on\n\"\n\" Brief help\n\" :PluginList       - lists configured plugins\n\" :PluginInstall    - installs plugins; append `!` to update or just :PluginUpdate\n\" :PluginSearch foo - searches for foo; append `!` to refresh local cache\n\" :PluginClean      - confirms removal of unused plugins; append `!` to auto-approve removal\n\"\n\" see :h vundle for more details or wiki for FAQ\n\" Put your non-Plugin stuff after this line\n```\n\nNext, to install plugins, open vim and run this command line below (by pressing Esc)\n\n`:PluginInstall`\n\nTo up date plugins, use `:PluginUpdate`\n\nThat’s enough for you to pick Vim up from the ground.\n\n## Basic Usage Instruction\n\nVim is a text-editor program first built on UNIX, in order to work in non-user interface environment. At this time, the keyboard hasn’t been upgraded completely, which is why the action on Vim is still different from today.\n\n![](assets/connecting-vim-with-golang_5ca1828b88d41d78ead1d47ac32aeabd_md5.webp)\n\nYou can practice using these keys by [vim game](https://vim-adventures.com/)\n\nTo open a new file with vim, use the command line: `vim file_name`\n\nThere are 3 modes in vim:\n\n- **Normal mode** - appear when you press Ecs, usually has “.” in front of it. Vim will get this as what you type is the command for vim. For example: `:w` is “save document”, `:q` is “exit document”. Vim has its own language, which is called Vim script. Vim script can be executed at normal mode, for example, to print out Hello world, we use\n\n`:echo \"hello world\"`\n\n- **Insert mode** -appear when you press one of these keys below\n\na: Insert vào phía sau con trỏ hiện tại A: Insert vào cuối hàng i: Insert vào phía trước con trỏ hiện tại I: Insert vào đầu hàng o: Insert và mở một hàng trống phía dưới O: Insert và mở một hàng trống phía trên\n\n- **Visual mode** – appear when you press v, usually used in selecting a big block text, can be used in copy paste or comment,..\n\nYou can read [vim command](http://bullium.com/support/vim.html) to know more about the commands in vim\n\n## Using Vim as Go IDE\n\nIn order to use Vim as an IDE for Go, we need to set up some plugins for Go.\n\nThe most important thing is [vim go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/). Vim Go contains a set of libraries that support Go for Vim, for example `godef`, `gofmt`, `go test`.\n\nTo install vim go, copy plugin to file .vimrc\n\n```javascript\nPlugin 'fatih/vim-go'\n```\n\nThen choosing normal mode by pressing `esc` and type this command\n\n```javascript\n:PluginInstall\n```\n\nNext, continue typing command to install Go binaries\n\n```javascript\n:GoInstallBinaries\n```\n\nYou can basically code Go with only Vim go, but to make things easier, and also enhance its efficiency, you can research and add up some plugins as below\n\n```javascript\nack.vim\nbclose.vim\nbufexplorer\nnerdtree\nnerdcommenter\ncsapprox\nvim - fugitive\ngitv\nvim - gitgutter\nsyntastic\nneocomplete.vim\nneosnippet.vim\nauto - pairs\n```\n\nIn these:\n\n- nerdtree: Help you organize the folders in vim in folder structure, which makes it easier to open file and folder. After finished setting up:\n\n![](assets/connecting-vim-with-golang_ac42721e6ddb17d3204d4596f55f96ce_md5.webp)\n\nThanks to plugin of git, you can know which file is under editing, which one has just been added up, and which one has not been committed yet.\n\n- neocomplete: Support auto complete vim\n\n![](assets/connecting-vim-with-golang_db43f35dc945a8dde4b51e4b97221c86_md5.webp)\n\n- autopair: Plugin that helps you to quick type using “ ( ‘ [ \u003c by adding “” () “ [] \u003c\u003e as a pair\n\n## Mapping Structure in Vim\n\nVim has a definition called mapping, which allows its user to mode their keystrokes to support their personal purposes.\n\n```javascript\nKhi tôi nhấn key này, tôi muốn bạn làm hành động này thay vì những gì bạn hay thường làm\n```\n\nExample: Type some sentences by vim, then run this command\n\n```javascript\n:map - x\n```\n\nPut your mouse on the text paragraph and press `-`. Vim will instantly delete the characters right under the mouse pointer, as if you’ve just pressed `x`.\n\nAt this time, your mapping only works on the text file that you’re editing. In order to mapping your action on all other files, put your mapping on file .vimrc Here are some of the common mappings:\n\n```javascript\nnmap    : used in normal mode\nimap    : used in insert mode\nvmap    : used in visual mode\nnoremap : can't be overridden by other mappings\n```\n\nFor example, when coding in Go, we usually use godef to find the definition of that function. In vim-go, we log into normal mode and type `GoDef` But we can mapping like this instead:\n\n```javascript\nnnoremap \u003csilent\u003e df :GoDef\u003ccr\u003e\n```\n\nThat means when we’re at normal mode, the keystrokes df will execute the command: `GoDef`. This Map can’t be overridden by any other normal map.Therefore, if you’re looking for a definition of a function, use the keystroke `df`. This will reduce the time of typing process.\n\nAnother example for mapping. I usually use [print](https://github.com/k0kubun/pp) library in print out a better result in terminal. The action of login to debug in Go happens regularly, so I set up a map like this:\n\n```javascript\ninoremap \u003csilent\u003e pp pp.Println(\"\")\n```\n\nThat means when I type in insert mode `pp`, it will automatically switch into `pp.Println(\"\")`, which enables me to code faster.\n\nYou can read more at [mapping in vim](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/map.html).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEverything is ready! Your only job is to:\n\n- Experienced in using hjkl in vim, as well as the basic commands in vim.\n- Search for more plugins to support for vim. This is a page I find very interesting and useful for [plugins in vim](http://vimawesome.com/).\n- The key strong point in vim is customization, you should try to figure out how to create new mappings or function that helps fasten your coding process.\n\nThese aspects is what I have learnt about Vim and how to code Go using Vim. There are a lot of things to discover in the world of Vim and I would love to hear all of your comments or sharing.\n","title":"Connecting Vim With Golang","short_title":"","description":"A comprehensive guide on using Vim as an IDE for Go development.

The extension pattern helps to add new features to an existing object without changing its original code. \n\n- Extending third-party packages: When you are working with a third-party package, and you want to add new methods or modify the behavior of existing types without forking or modifying the original package.\n- Adding functionality to interfaces: When a package provides a minimal interface and you want to add additional behaviors on top of that without changing the underlying implementation.\n- Testing: You can use the extension interface pattern to mock or adapt behaviors of a type for testing purposes, adding features like logging, metrics, or other cross-cutting concerns.\n\nWhether you are working with the standard library (`io`, `http`, `sql`), third-party packages, or your own codebase, this pattern provides a way to add functionality in a flexible, non-intrusive manner.\n\n### 1. **Extending `io.Reader` and `io.Writer`**\n\nThe `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` interfaces are simple but versatile interfaces that are widely used in Go. You can extend them to add features like compression, encryption, logging, or even buffering.\n\n**Example: adding logging to an `io.Writer`**\n\nLet’s say you want to add logging functionality to an `io.Writer`. You can use the extension interface pattern to wrap an existing `io.Writer` and log any data written to it.\n\n```go\ntype LoggingWriter struct {\n    io.Writer  // Embed the original io.Writer\n}\n\nfunc (lw LoggingWriter) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error) {\n    fmt.Printf(\"Writing %d bytes: %s\\n\", len(p), string(p))  // Log the write\n    return lw.Writer.Write(p)  // Call the original Write method\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    var writer io.Writer = LoggingWriter{Writer: os.Stdout}\n    \n    writer.Write([]byte(\"Hello, World!\"))  \n    // Output:\n    // Writing 13 bytes: Hello, World!\n    // Hello, World!\n}\n```\n\nThis allows you to add logging to any writer without modifying the original `io.Writer` type.\n\n### 2. **Extending HTTP middleware in `http.Handler`**\n\nIn web development with Go, the `http.Handler` interface is central to building web servers. It’s common to use the extension interface pattern to create middleware that extends the behavior of `http.Handler`.\n\n**Example: Adding a request logger middleware**\n\nYou can create middleware that wraps an `http.Handler` to log HTTP requests.\n\n```go\ntype LoggingMiddleware struct {\n    handler http.Handler\n}\n\nfunc (lm LoggingMiddleware) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    fmt.Printf(\"Received request: %s %s\\n\", r.Method, r.URL.Path)  // Log request\n    lm.handler.ServeHTTP(w, r)  // Call the original handler\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    originalHandler := http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n        w.Write([]byte(\"Hello, World!\"))\n    })\n\n    loggingHandler := LoggingMiddleware{handler: originalHandler}\n    http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", loggingHandler)\n}\n```\n\nThis example extends `http.Handler` to log incoming requests, wrapping the original handler without modifying it.\n\n### 3. **Extending `sql.DB` for database connections**\n\nYou can extend the `sql.DB` type from Go’s `database/sql` package to add functionalities like logging, connection retries, or metrics tracking.\n\n**Example: Adding query logging to `sql.DB`**\n\n```go\ntype LoggingDB struct {\n    *sql.DB  // Embed the original sql.DB\n}\n\nfunc (ldb LoggingDB) Query(query string, args ...interface{}) (*sql.Rows, error) {\n    fmt.Printf(\"Executing query: %s\\n\", query)  // Log the query\n    return ldb.DB.Query(query, args...)\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    db, _ := sql.Open(\"mysql\", \"user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/dbname\")\n    \n    loggingDB := LoggingDB{DB: db}\n    loggingDB.Query(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\n}\n```\n\nThis extension allows you to log SQL queries without altering the behavior of `sql.DB`.\n\n### 4. **Adding caching to HTTP clients**\n\nGo’s `http.Client` is a widely used type for making HTTP requests. You can extend `http.Client` to add caching, retries, or additional logging.\n\n**Example: adding caching to an `http.Client`**\n\nYou can wrap an `http.Client` to cache responses based on URLs.\n\n```go\ntype CachingClient struct {\n    client   *http.Client\n    cache    map[string]*http.Response\n}\n\nfunc (cc *CachingClient) Do(req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {\n    if cachedResp, ok := cc.cache[req.URL.String()]; ok {\n        fmt.Println(\"Returning cached response\")\n        return cachedResp, nil\n    }\n    \n    resp, err := cc.client.Do(req)\n    if err == nil {\n        cc.cache[req.URL.String()] = resp\n    }\n    return resp, err\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    httpClient := \u0026http.Client{}\n    cachingClient := \u0026CachingClient{\n        client: httpClient,\n        cache:  make(map[string]*http.Response),\n    }\n\n    req, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://example.com\", nil)\n    cachingClient.Do(req)  // Fetches from the internet and caches the result\n    cachingClient.Do(req)  // Uses the cached result\n}\n```\n\nThis allows you to extend the functionality of the `http.Client` without altering the original type, adding caching behavior.\n\n### 5. **Adding context or timeouts to `http.Request`**\n\nGo's `http.Request` does not have built-in timeout functionality, but you can extend the `http.Request` type to add it.\n\n**Example: timeout extension for `http.Request`**\n\n```go\ntype TimeoutRequest struct {\n    req *http.Request\n    timeout time.Duration\n}\n\nfunc (tr *TimeoutRequest) Do(client *http.Client) (*http.Response, error) {\n    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(tr.req.Context(), tr.timeout)\n    defer cancel()\n\n    reqWithTimeout := tr.req.WithContext(ctx)\n    return client.Do(reqWithTimeout)\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    req, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://example.com\", nil)\n    timeoutReq := \u0026TimeoutRequest{\n        req:     req,\n        timeout: 2 * time.Second,\n    }\n\n    client := \u0026http.Client{}\n    timeoutReq.Do(client)  // The request will timeout after 2 seconds\n}\n```\n\nThis allows you to extend `http.Request` with timeout functionality without modifying the original type.\n\n### 6. **Decorators for `fmt.Stringer`**\n\nGo’s `fmt.Stringer` is a simple but powerful interface used for customizing string representations of types. You can use the extension interface pattern to add additional behaviors when printing.\n\n**Example: Add a prefix to `fmt.Stringer`**\n\nYou can wrap a `fmt.Stringer` type to add a prefix to its string representation.\n\n```go\ntype PrefixedStringer struct {\n    prefix string\n    fmt.Stringer\n}\n\nfunc (ps PrefixedStringer) String() string {\n    return ps.prefix + ps.Stringer.String()\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```go\ntype User struct {\n    Name string\n}\n\nfunc (u User) String() string {\n    return u.Name\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    user := User{Name: \"John\"}\n    prefixedUser := PrefixedStringer{prefix: \"User: \", Stringer: user}\n\n    fmt.Println(prefixedUser.String())  // Output: User: John\n}\n```\nThis wraps the original `fmt.Stringer` and adds a prefix to the output.\n\n----\n\nThat's good as far as it goes, but I think the key part of extension interfaces is why they're useful and how they're used -- they can add optional functionality to an API which (according to the statically-checked type signature) only takes the \"base\" interface.\n\nFor example, [io.WriteString](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#WriteString) is one of the simplest examples of an extension interface: it takes a plain io.Writer, but if that writer has been extended to support the `io.StringWriter` interface (i.e., has the `WriteString` method), it will use that for efficiency, otherwise fall back to the regular Write method which all io.Writer implementations have.\n\nSticking with your `File` / `ReadDirFile` example, the `fs.Open` method returns a plain File, but if the \"file\" is actually a directory, you can convert it to a `ReadDirFile` and use the `ReadDir` extension method. Something like:\n\n```go\nf, _ := fs.Open(\"dir_or_file\") // in real life, handle errors\nst, _ := f.Stat()\nif st.IsDir() {\n    // f is a directory\n    d := f.(ReadDirFile)\n    d.ReadDir(10)\n} else {\n    // f is a normal file\n}\n```\n\nAs an alternative to calling st.IsDir() (and what would probably be more typical for extension interfaces), you could just check whether the file implements the interface directly, like so:\n\n```go\nf, _ := fs.Open(\"dir_or_file\")\nif d, ok := f.(ReadDirFile); ok {\n    // f is a directory\n    d.ReadDir(10)\n} else {\n    // f is a normal file\n}\n```\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/i6yehu/what_is_the_extension_interface_pattern_in_go/)","title":"Go extension interface pattern","short_title":"","description":"Note about using Go extension interface pattern","tags":["go","interface"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao"],"date":"Fri Oct 25 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/go/extension-interface-pattern.md","slugArray":["playground","go","extension-interface-pattern"]},{"content":"\n## Golang concurrency\n\nWhen we talk about Golang, its most basic and popular characteristic is concurrency-support. Unlike other languages what is quite complex to build an concurrency system, Go concurrency primitives via Goroutines and channels make concurrent programming easy. So i am going to talk about Goroutines and similar things in other programming languages.\n\nFirstly, we need to know Go is a concurrent language and not a parallel one. So what is the difference from concurrency and parallelism?\n\n### Concurrency vs Parallelism\n\nConcurrency means “out of order” execution. Another concept talk about concurrency as the capability to deal with lots of things at once. It's best explained with an example in real life: During playing Dota 2, let’s say, my mom asked me to buy something. Now i stop playing, go to the grocery and then starts playing again with rebuke of my team. This is a basic example of concurrency. In computing, concurrency is represented by the state when two or more tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. It doesn't necessarily mean they'll ever both be running at the same time. Multitasking on a single-core machine is an example.\n\nParallelism is doing lots of things at the same time like other running tasks on a multicore processor. Let’s come back with the example above. Instead of taking order my mother, I play the game and listen to music at once freely. In this case, playing game and listening to music is \"lots of things\".\n\n![](assets/go-concurrency_9cb01cacb1edc3373acd7570cc280cd7_md5.webp)\n\nAfter understanding the way to compare concurrency with parallelism, we can research about Goroutines/channel and other well.\n\n### Goroutines\n\nGoroutines can be understood like a light weight thread. Instead of OS, Goroutines exists only in the virtual space of Go runtime. A Goroutines is started up with initial 2KB of stack size (This is the location where store answer of the question \"what is this Go routine's current state?\". It is contains local variables as well as pointers to heap allocated variables). Because Go’s stacks are dynamically sized, growing and shrinking with the amount of data stored. So we need only 4KB memory for Goroutines.\n\n![](assets/go-concurrency_d82335b0ffffc63ae92aa7339a5867e8_md5.webp)\n\nGoroutines are cheaper than others thing like it (thread) in other programming language because of ability growing and shrinking depend on programmer's desire. e.g a Java thread initially have 4MB while go-routine is somewhere around 2KB.\n\nWhile some languages take an \"concurrency at OS level\" approach. Go implemented its own scheduler in order to keep concurrency concept at language level.\n\n### Channel\n\nChannel is a communication tool for Goroutines. Channel can be understand like pipes. So similar to water flows from one end to another in pipes, a Goroutines write data in one end and we can get it in another by using Channel.\n\nEach channel has a type associated. This type decide data type that channel is allowed to transport and no other types can access into it.\n\nWhen a data is sent to a channel, the control is blocked in the send statement until some other Go-routine reads from that channel. Similarly when data is read from a channel, the read is blocked until some Go-routine writes data to that channel. It also mean these are **unbuffered**.\n\nIn other words, by default Go channel are **unbuffered**.\n\nSo how to break this limit?\n\nLike the way God made Eve from a part of Adam, Go provide another channel type that can buffered.\n\nFor buffered channel, providing the buffer length as the second argument to make to initialize a buffered channel:\n\n```plain_text\n messages := make(chan string, capacity)\n```\n\nCapacity should be greater than 0 for a channel to have a buffer and we can send data to our channel until this is full, similar receives will not block when we read data until empty.\n\n![](assets/go-concurrency_eb379f648c223af56819605adfeb118d_md5.webp)\n\n## Under the hood\n\n### Channel implementation\n\nWhen we implement a Go channel, a struct will be created, then it looks like following.\n\nTo have a comprehensive view, we have a few descriptions about the fields encountered in the channel structure.\n\n![](assets/go-concurrency_23c2cb6d27ce23dcdc500decd9a59398_md5.webp)\n\n- **buf** is the location where our data is actually stored. It is a circular queue.\n- **dataqsize** is size of the circular queue. It represent capability of channel. When we declare make(chan int, N), **dataqsize** is N. It also let us know how many Goroutines can write data into this channel until blocked\n\n![](assets/go-concurrency_966768c61d35099632b9e31f581807c6_md5.webp)\n\n- **qcount** represents the number of slots in the buf currently filled up.\n- **elemsize** Is the size of a channel corresponding to a single element.\n- **elemtype** used when messages are copied over from one Go-routine to the other. It has a bunch of fields which provide type and size information for the type of values the channel can hold.\n- **closed** Indicates whether the current channel is in the closed state. After a channel is created, this field is set to 0, that is, the channel is open; by calling close to set it to 1, the channel is closed.\n\n![](assets/go-concurrency_80543471c1dd9c44e63c7fa281d4b6c0_md5.webp)\n\n- **sendx** and **recvx** indicates the current index of buffer — backing array from where it can send data and receive data.\n- **recvq** and **sendq** waiting queues, which are used to store the blocked Goroutines while trying to read data on the channel or while trying to send data from the channel.\n- **lock** protects all fields in **hchan**, as well as fields in sudogs blocked on this channel.\n- **sudog** struct is described in Golang source as a Go Routine in a wait list, such as for sending/receiving on a channel.\n-\n\nWe mentioned about sudog struct above. What is sudog? See the following image:\n\n![](assets/go-concurrency_2ec27e55f9c531e5aab4f885f5915f30_md5.webp)\n\nWe have a full description for sudog struct in source. If something confuse, ignore it by looking at the original concept. Then we have a good description about sudog: sudog represents a Goroutine. recvq and sendq hold the information on the Goroutines which are currently blocking on the channel while receiving and sending respectively. They are pointers to sudog.\n\nAn example to know what happen when we declare Goroutines and channel.\n\n![](assets/go-concurrency_026784030ef13c5d006328ea47cfc657_md5.webp)\n\nWhat will be the structure of the channel before line **No 22?**\n\n![](assets/go-concurrency_28bee5f5381e186532a5ceda7746c017_md5.webp)\n\nIn Our Example Code before line 22 there are two Goroutines (goroutineA and goroutineB ) trying to read data from the channel ch.\n\nSince before line 22 on a channel, there is no data we have put on the channel so both the Goroutines blocked for receive operation have been wrapped inside the **sudog** struct and is present on the recvq of the channel. **recvq** and **sendq** are basically linked list, which looks basically as below\n\n![](assets/go-concurrency_2da8e4e08c9af6c09a70149ce0bee0c1_md5.webp)\n\n### Go scheduler\n\nTo understand Go scheduler quickly, we will review a few concepts in OS and OS scheduler that support a program is runnable. If you knew about OS thread and OS scheduler, you should skip following section and jump to next part.\n\nComputer Program is just a series of machine instructions that need to be executed one after other sequentially. So thread was born in other to account and sequentially execute the set of instructions it was assigned.\n\nWhen we run a program, a process is initiated with a thread. A thread have the ability to create more threads. A thread can run parallel or concurrently and keep their own state is safe, local and independent execution of their instructions.\n\nThe OS scheduler is an operating system module that is responsible for making sure cores are not idle if there are threads that can be executing. It must also create the illusion that all the threads that can execute are executing at the same time.\n\nIf you are running on Linux, Mac or Windows, you are running on an OS that has a preemptive scheduler. This means a few important things. First, it means the scheduler is unpredictable when it comes to what Threads will be chosen to run at any given time. Thread priorities together with events, (like receiving data on the network) make it impossible to determine what the scheduler will choose to do and when.\n\nExisting a piece called Program Counter in a Thread that allows the thread keep track of the next instruction to execute.\n\n![](assets/go-concurrency_bf66c5b925d9c162acc9d0fb055c353e_md5.webp)\n\nThere are 3 states in thread\n\n- **Waiting**: This means the Thread is stopped and waiting for something in order to continue. “Something” is waiting for the hardware (disk, network), system calls, synchronization calls (atomic, mutexes).\n- **Runnable**: This means the Thread wants time on a core so it can execute its assigned machine instructions.\n- **Executing**: This means the Thread has been placed on a core and is executing its machine instructions.\n\nAnd 2 types of works\n\n- **CPU-Bound**: This is work that never creates a situation where the Thread may be placed in Waiting states.\n- **IO-Bound**: This is work that causes Threads to enter into Waiting states. This is work that consists in requesting access to a resource over the network or making system calls into the operating system. **Context switches** is the duration that we swap a thread on and of a core. It take between ~1000 and ~1500 nanoseconds to do its work while the hardware should be able to reasonably execute averagely 12 instructions per nanosecond per core. So a context switch can cost we ~12k to ~18k instructions of latency. In essence, a context switch make lower performance by losing ability to execute a lot of machine instructions. It look like suitable with IO-Bound work but not with CPU-Bound work that requires work constantly.\n\nAfter surfing over above all things, we have ability to understand following part quickly. It is the section that describe about GO scheduler and how it make Goroutines faster than threads.\n\n### Getting started\n\nWhen our program start up, it’s given a Logical Processor (P) for every virtual core identified on the host machine. So how many virtual core exist in your computer? Suppose that we have a Macbook with following system report:\n\n![](assets/go-concurrency_8c56d98dd1917a5c479f487977ccfb9f_md5.webp)\n\nWe have 1 processor with total 4 cores. As you see the report don’t let us know directly how many virtual core here. But the Intel Core i7 processor has Hyper-Threading, which means there are 2 hardware threads per physical core. This will report to the Go program that 8 virtual cores are available for executing OS Threads in parallel. In another word, a hardware thread serve for a virtual cores.\n\nEvery P is assigned an OS Thread (M) that stands for machine. This means when I run a Go program on my machine, I have 8 available threads to execute my work, each individually attached to a P.\n\nEvery Go program is also given an initial Go-routine (G). Just as OS Threads are context-switched on and off a core, Goroutines are context-switched on and off an M.\n\nEach P is given a Local Run Queue LRQ that manages the Goroutines assigned to be executed within the context of a P. These Goroutines take turns being context-switched on and off the M assigned to that P. The Global Run Queue(GRQ) is for Goroutines that have not been assigned to a P yet. There is a process to move Goroutines from the GRQ to a LRQ that we will discuss later.\n\nFollowing figure provides an image of all these components together\n\n![](assets/go-concurrency_ad2ef462e022466f3eab445763ef2bda_md5.webp)\n\nThe Go scheduler is part of the Go runtime, which is built into our application. This means the Go scheduler runs in user space. The current implementation of the Go schedule is a cooperating scheduler that needs well-defined user space events.\n\nWe can’t predict what the Go scheduler is going to do. This is because decision making for this cooperating scheduler doesn’t rest in the hands of developers, but in the Go runtime. It’s important to think of the Go scheduler as a preemptive scheduler and since the scheduler is non-deterministic, this is not much of a stretch.\n\nThere are four classes of events that occur in your Go programs that allow the scheduler to make scheduling decisions. This doesn’t mean it will always happen on one of these events. It means the scheduler gets the opportunity.\n\n- The use of the keyword go\n- Garbage collection\n- System calls\n","title":"Go Concurrency","short_title":"","description":"A comprehensive guide to concurrency in Go, covering goroutines, channels, and the Go scheduler.

The language, originally named Oak. was designed for use in embedded systems. However, the name Oak was soon found to be unsuitable for trademark protection, as it had already been used by numerous other companies. In a strategic move, Sun Microsystems renamed the language to Java, inspired by the coffee that the developers drank during their coding sessions. Java was then released for free online, and quickly gained popularity among developers.\n\nSun Microsystems recognized early on the commercial potential of Java. By promoting Java as a versatile and industry-standard language, Sun created a significant revenue stream from licensing fees, services, and software sales. The company also leveraged its hardware business by ensuring that Java was natively supported on its Solaris operating system. This synergy between Java and Solaris meant that Sun could market its hardware as “Java-compatible,” thus driving both software and hardware sales.\n\nFurthermore, Sun's promotion of Java as a language capable of running on any system, thanks to its \"write once, run anywhere\" capability, addressed a long-standing issue of software incompatibility across different platforms. This feature was especially appealing to enterprises, which often operate in diverse technological environments.\n\nThe introduction of Java EE (now Jakarta EE) in December 1999 was a pivotal moment, providing a comprehensive set of technologies and APIs designed specifically for large-scale, distributed, transactional, and mission-critical applications. This suite of tools further cemented Java's place in the enterprise software world, offering a robust framework for developing and deploying complex applications.\n\n### Why Java is an Enterprise Programming Language\n\n- Enterprise applications are rarely standalone; they often comprise multiple interacting systems that must communicate seamlessly. Java excels in **supporting both synchronous and asynchronous messaging**. The language natively supports communication formats such as XML, JSON, and Protocol Buffers (Protobuf), which are integral to facilitating data exchange between applications and services.\n- With the growing trend towards web-based interfaces, enterprise applications need to provide **robust web interactions**. Java's ecosystem includes extensive libraries and frameworks for developing web applications and web services. Technologies like JavaServer Pages (JSP), Servlets, and frameworks such as Spring and Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE) enable developers to create scalable and secure web applications, crucial for today’s browser-based enterprise solutions.\n- Data is the backbone of enterprise applications, and the ability to interact with various databases is crucial. Java **provides high-quality drivers** for both relational databases (RDBMS) and NoSQL databases.\n- Security is a critical concern for enterprises, and Java’s emphasis on safety helps mitigate risks. Unlike languages like C and C++, which are prone to memory management issues such as buffer overflows and dangling pointers, Java **is designed to be memory-safe**.\n- Managing user access and authentication efficiently is vital for enterprise systems. Java **integrates well with various authentication and authorization protocols**, including LDAP, Active Directory, SAML, and OAuth. These integrations facilitate centralized management of user identities and permissions, streamlining access control across the enterprise.\n- Java **benefits from a large talent pool**, as it is widely taught in academic institutions and has extensive community support. This widespread adoption **makes it easier for enterprises to hire qualified developers** and **leverage the collective knowledge** of a large Java community.\n- Enterprises require the flexibility to host applications on various platforms, and Java’s \"write once, run anywhere\" principle plays a crucial role here. Java applications **can be deployed across different operating systems and cloud environments**, such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. This flexibility allows businesses to select the most cost-effective and stable hosting solutions and adapt as their needs evolve.\n- Ongoing maintenance and performance monitoring are critical for enterprise applications. Java **supports a wide range of Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools**, including ElasticAPM and DataDog, which help in tracking application health and performance. Furthermore, Java’s static typing and compilation process make it **easier to refactor code and identify issues before deployment**, enhancing the overall maintainability of applications.\n- Java **boasts a rich ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, tools, and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**. This extensive support accelerates development processes and enhances productivity by providing developers with pre-built solutions and utilities.\n\n### Why Java and not C/C++\n\nEven though C/C++ is considered faster than Java in almost every benchmark, Java is still more popular because:\n\n- Java is easier to use. This results in shorter development time.\n- Java is slower than C/C++, but still fast enough for most use cases. As most applications spend time waiting for I/O and network calls to finish, the run speed of a programming language isn't a primary concern in most cases.\n- Java is memory-safe, and doesn't require memory management thanks to its garbage collector.\n- Java is platform-independent. Thanks to the JVM, you can run Java software on various platforms.\n\n=\u003e For these reasons, Java gradually becomes a popular language, and is widely used among enterprises.\n\n#### Citations\n\n- BSCAL. _\"Sun Launches Promotion Of Java\"_, Financial Times Limited 1997, Nov 07 1997.

Rob Pike’s frustration with slow C++ compilation times led him to discuss the issue with Robert Griesemer, and Ken Thompson, working nearby, joined in. Their collaboration aimed to address the inefficiencies they faced with existing languages in Google’s large-scale environment.\n\nGoogle’s software infrastructure, involving millions of lines of code and extensive use of C++, Java, and Python, required a language that balanced efficient compilation, fast execution, and ease of use. The existing languages fell short, prompting the team to create Go, which began as a 20% project in September 2007. By January 2008, work on the initial compiler started, and Go was open-sourced in November 2009. It reached its first stable release in March 2012.\n\nGo was designed to improve software development efficiency and scalability at Google. It focused on addressing issues like slow compilation and cumbersome programming practices to enhance productivity and simplify management of large codebases. The language’s design emphasizes practical software engineering solutions over theoretical language research.\n\n### What Go Offers\n\nGo, also known as Golang, stands out as an ideal choice for an enterprise programming language. These are a few of Go’s strong points, which makes it possible for this language to be chosen among enterprises:\n\n- **Simple and Easy to Learn:** Go is designed to be straightforward. Its language features are minimal but effective, allowing developers to grasp and use them quickly. With just a few days of study, developers can become proficient in Go, making it easy to onboard new team members and maintain consistent coding standards across a team.\n- **Fast Compilation and Execution:** One of Go's biggest advantages is its fast compilation time. Unlike languages like C++ or Java, which can be slow to compile, Go produces binaries quickly. This means you spend less time waiting for your code to build and more time actually writing and improving it. Additionally, Go binaries run as fully optimized native code, meaning they start up fast and use CPU cores efficiently.\n- **Easy Maintenance and Collaboration:** Go promotes code simplicity and clarity. Its standardized formatting and idiomatic ways of doing things make code easy to read and understand. This consistency reduces the cognitive load on developers, making it easier to review, debug, and collaborate on code. Go’s toolchain also supports automated code formatting and refactoring.\n- **No Runtime Dependencies:** Go applications are standalone binaries, which means they don't rely on external runtimes or libraries. This results in significantly smaller Docker images compared to languages like Java or Node.js. Deployment is also simplified because you don’t need to worry about installing additional software or managing runtime versions on your servers.\n- **Explicit Error Handling:** Go takes a different approach to error handling by requiring developers to handle errors explicitly, making error management clear and predictable. This explicitness helps in identifying and addressing issues more effectively, making your applications more reliable.\n- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Go’s runtime is lightweight and designed to be portable across various platforms, including macOS, Linux, and Windows.\n- **Modern Object-Oriented Features:** Go embraces modern object-oriented principles while avoiding problematic features like inheritance. Instead, it supports composition, which provides better flexibility and scalability. This makes it easier for developers that are already familiar with OOP to switch to Go.\n- **Future-Proof:** Go is designed with forward compatibility in mind. Software written in Go will continue to work with newer versions of the language, making it easier to upgrade and benefit from performance and security improvements over time.\n\n### In which scenarios can Go do better than Java\n\n- **When building small to medium-sized services:** Because Go has no virtual machine, huge platform libraries, or a sophisticated garbage collector, and it compiles directly to machine code and supports static linking, Go has a very fast load times and very efficient resource usage. This makes it very easy to quickly spin up a new service with good performance. But when it comes to building large and complex services, Java is a better choice as it has more features and better support, along with a more \"concrete\" code structure.\n- **When building cloud-native, serverless applications:** Because of Go's simplicity and performance, a service written in Go takes minimal time to be spun up compared to those written in Java. This makes it ideal to use Go for building serverless applications, in which the cold start time is usually a problem worth considering.\n- **When doing extensive concurrent programming:** Both Golang and Java provide support for concurrent programming. With Java, you can only manage green threads through JVM, which inevitably suffer from context switching and fixed stack size. Go, however, shines in this area with its goroutines and channels. Goroutines are essentially lightweight threads that are managed by the Go runtime, allowing developers to write highly concurrent code easily. This makes Go an excellent choice for applications that require efficient handling of thousands of simultaneous tasks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo conclude, when it comes to picking a language for application development, Go is a viable option for enterprises. However, it is not likely that Go will completely replace Java, simply because there is no strong reason and enough benefits for companies to migrate entirely from Java to Go. Java is mostly used for developing Android mobile applications, data processing and transforming, and building applications with complex requirements which are heavily reliant on Java's vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Go is more suitable for building small to medium services, serverless applications, and gives a higher performance when doing concurrent programming. Both languages excel in different areas, and can be used in tandem to build high-performance and reliable applications.\n\n### Citations\n\n- Team Veltris. _\"Golang: A Key Programming Language in Future Enterprise Application Development\"_, Veltris Blog, December 9, 2019.

This update allowed Go developers to write more flexible and reusable code by supporting type parameters, enabling functions, and data structures to work with different types without sacrificing type safety.\n\nBefore this, Go was known for its simplicity and type safety but lacked the kind of flexibility that generics bring, which is a feature common in other languages like Java, C#, and C++. Generics were one of the most anticipated features in Go's development, and the 1.18 release was a significant milestone for the language.\n\nGo achieves type safety with generics through **type parameters** and **type constraints**. Here’s how it works:\n\n### 1. Type Parameters\n\nWhen you define a function, method, or data structure with generics, you specify a type parameter in square brackets `[]`. This type parameter allows the function or type to accept different types without being tied to a specific one. However, the type still needs to conform to certain rules, which leads to the next part—**type constraints**.\n\nExample of a generic function with type parameters:\n\n```go\nfunc Print[T any](items []T) {\n    for _, item := range items {\n        fmt.Println(item)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, `T` is a type parameter, and `any` is a built-in constraint that allows any type.\n\n### 2. Type Constraints\n\nType constraints are used to limit what types the type parameter `T` can represent. Go enforces type safety by ensuring that the types passed to a generic function or type comply with these constraints. A type constraint can either be a specific interface or a built-in constraint like `comparable`, `any`, or custom-defined ones.\n\nExample using a constraint:\n\n```go\n// A custom constraint interface that requires a type to implement a method\ntype Stringer interface {\n    String() string\n}\n\nfunc ToString[T Stringer](val T) string {\n    return val.String()\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, only types that implement the `Stringer` interface can be used as `T`, ensuring type safety at compile time.\n\n### 3. Compile-Time Checking\n\nGo’s compiler checks the types at compile time. If the provided type doesn’t satisfy the constraint, the program won’t compile, ensuring that incorrect types are not passed to a function or data structure. This is crucial for maintaining Go’s philosophy of simplicity and robustness in type safety.\n\n### 4. Underlying Type Consistency\n\nGo also leverages underlying types in some constraints. For example, the `comparable` constraint ensures that the type parameter can be compared using `==` or `!=`. For this to work, the compiler ensures that any type passed to a function constrained by `comparable` supports these operations, preventing runtime errors.\n\n### 5. Explicit and Simple Type Inference\n\nGo simplifies type safety by inferring types when possible. If the compiler can deduce the type parameter from the context, you don’t need to explicitly specify it, but the compiler still checks that the type is valid according to the constraints.\n\nExample with inferred type:\n\n```go\nfunc Add[T int | float64](a, b T) T {\n    return a + b\n}\n\nresult := Add(3.0, 4.5) // Go infers T as float64\n```\n\n### Commutative Diagram\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{CD}\n\\text{GenericCode} @\u003e\\text{Parse}\u003e\u003e \\text{AST} @\u003e\\text{TypeCheck}\u003e\u003e \\text{TypedAST} \\\\\n@V\\text{Instantiate}VV @V\\text{Infer}VV @VV\\text{Compile}V \\\\\n\\text{ConcreteCode} @\u003e\u003e\\text{Verify}\u003e \\text{TypeSafeCode} @\u003e\u003e\\text{Generate}\u003e \\text{ExecutableCode}\n\\end{CD}\n$$\n\n\nThis diagram shows the process of how Go handles generic code:\n\n1. Generic code is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).\n2. The AST undergoes type checking, which involves constraint checking and type inference.\n3. The resulting TypedAST is then compiled into executable code.\n4. Alternatively, generic code can be instantiated with concrete types, verified for type safety, and then generated into executable code.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn conclusion, Go achieves type safety with generics through a combination of compile-time type checking, constraint satisfaction, and type inference.\n\n1. **Type parameters** that allow flexibility.\n2. **Type constraints** to enforce rules about what types are allowed.\n3. **Compile-time type checking** to prevent invalid types from being used.\n4. **Simple and explicit type inference** while maintaining safety through constraints.\n","title":"How does Go achieve type safety when it enables generics?","short_title":"","description":"A quick note on How does Go achieve type safety when it enables generics","tags":["golang","generics"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao"],"date":"Mon Oct 14 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/go/go-generics-type-safety.md","slugArray":["playground","go","go-generics-type-safety"]},{"content":"\nGo’s import system, linked directly to git repository paths, was crucial to its early adoption. Unlike most languages, Go’s approach tightly integrates version control with package management, enhancing developer experience and reusability.\n\nUsing the git repository URL as the import path gives each package a unique identity, eliminating namespace conflicts and simplifying dependency management.\n\nExample:\n\n```go\nimport \"github.com/username/projectname/package\"\n```\n\nThis approach avoids complex dependency tools, ensuring packages are isolated and traceable—a simple yet effective structure that keeps Go codebases clean and organized.\n\n### Key benefits\n\n**Global uniqueness**  \nGit paths give each package a unique identifier (e.g., `github.com/user/repo/package`), avoiding namespace issues, especially in large projects with numerous dependencies.\n\n**Direct version control**  \nGo modules let developers pin dependencies to specific git tags or commits, achieving reproducible builds without a central registry. Any git repository, public or private, can serve as a Go package source, reducing reliance on third-party registries.\n\n**Modularity and reusability**  \nGit paths encourage modular, self-contained packages, making code easier to reuse and maintain. Direct links to git repositories also simplify code inspection and troubleshooting.\n\n### Comparison to other Languages\n\nMost other languages, like Python, Java, and Ruby, rely on centralized registries (e.g., PyPI, Maven) where packages are fetched by name, often leading to naming conflicts. Go’s git-based identifier, by contrast, provides a direct source link, eliminating centralized naming conventions. Go developers can pull packages directly from repositories, pin versions with `go.mod`, and enjoy simplified, traceable dependency management.\n\nExample `go.mod`:\n\n```go\nmodule myproject\n\ngo 1.20\n\nrequire (\n    github.com/user/mathlib v1.3.0\n    github.com/otheruser/utils v0.9.2\n)\n```\n\nGo’s git path-based imports connect package management directly to version control, prioritizing simplicity, clarity, and reusability—key reasons behind Go’s adoption as a preferred language for modular software development.\n\n----\n\n### Go's old $GOPATH story for development and dependencies\n\n[Source](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoTheGopathDevelopmentStory)\n\nAs people generally tell the story today, [Go](https://golang.org/) was originally developed without support for dependency management. Various community efforts evolved over time and then [were swept away](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoIsGooglesLanguage) in 2019 by [Go Modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules), which finally added core support for dependency management. I happen to feel that this story is a little bit incomplete and sells the original Go developers short, because I think they did originally have a story for how Go development and dependency management was supposed to work. To me, one of the fascinating bits in Go's evolution to modules is how that original story didn't work out. Today I'm going to outline how I see that original story.\n\nIn Go 1.0, the idea was that you would have one or more of what are today called [multi-module workspaces](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces). Each workspace contained one (or several) of your projects and all of its dependencies, in the form of cloned and checked-out repositories. With separate repositories, each workspace could have different (and independent) versions of the same packages if you needed that, and updating the version of one dependency in one workspace wouldn't update any other workspace. Your current workspace would be chosen by setting and changing `$GOPATH`, and the workspace would contain not just the source code but also precompiled build artifacts, built binaries, and so on, all hermetically confined under its `$GOPATH`.\n\nThis story of multiple `$GOPATH` workspaces allows each separate package or package set of yours to be wrapped up in a directory hierarchy that effectively has all of its dependencies 'vendored' into it. If you want to preserve this for posterity or give someone else a copy of it, you can archive or send the whole directory tree, or at least the src/ portion of it. The whole thing is fairly similar to a materialized Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).\n\n(The original version of Go did not default `$GOPATH` to `$HOME/go`, per for example [the Go 1.1 release notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.1#gocmd). It would take until [Go 1.8 for this default to be added](https://go.dev/doc/go1.8#gopath).)\n\nThis story broadly assumes that updates to dependencies will normally be compatible, because otherwise you really want to track the working dependency versions even in a workspace. While you can try to update a dependency and then roll it back (since you normally have its checked out repository with full history), Go won't help you by remembering the identity of the old, working version. It's up to you to dig this out with tools like [the git reflog](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog) or your own memory that you were at version 'x.y.z' of the package before you updated it. And 'go get -u' to update all your dependencies at once only makes sense if their new versions will normally all work.\n\nThis story also leaves copying workspaces to give them to someone else (or to preserve them in their current state) as a problem for you, not Go. However, Go did add ['experimental' support for vendoring dependencies](https://go.dev/doc/go1.5) in Go 1.5, which allowed people to create self-contained objects that could be used with 'go get' or other simple repository copying and cloning. A package that had its dependencies fully vendored was effectively a miniature workspace, but this approach had some drawbacks of its own.\n\nI feel this original story, while limited, is broadly not unreasonable. It could have worked, at least in theory, in a world where preserving API compatibility (in a broad sense) is much more common than it clearly is (or isn't) in this one.","title":"Go import design: using git repo path","short_title":"","description":"Go’s use of git repository paths as package identifiers is a unique and powerful feature.

Go fits the bill with:\n\n## Simplicity\n\nGo's beauty lies in its powerful simplicity. A list of NO's in Go design contains generics, ternary operation, pointer arithmetic,…. These features are missing because it doesn't fit, and it affects compilation speed, and end up making the language too complicated.\n\nIt's not what it included that makes it great; it's what is left out. Even at the expense of writing more code, simplicity acts as a key feature.\n\n### First-class support for Concurrency\n\nGo is not the first language that comes up with concurrency. We had Erlang for that a while ago. But Go is one of the few mainstream languages get it right.\n\nRelying on CSP \u0026 \"sharing by communicating\" model plus the light-weight go-routine implementation makes concurrent programming perform at the best experience. If concurrency plays a vital part in your application, Go should be the first thing in your mind.\n\n### Interface-driven OOP\n\nThis guy enables duck typing and dependency injection, two forms that extremely fruitful while avoiding the complexities of inheritance, which proves a notable downside in practice.\n\n## Why Go\n\nLet's be frank, Go is not a language for everything.\n\n- It can't compare with Elixir in term of development speed.\n- Rust beats it hard when it comes to performance.\n- Simplicity alone? Try Python\n\nGo has its place and shines the brightest with the following application types:\n\n- Cloud application: Go's native feature set made it a naturally fit for the cloud, with concurrency built-in feature, Go is the best choice in the market for the two most common architecture in the cloud: micro-services and distributed system.\n- Utilities and stand-alone tools: Go was born to beat the compilation time. It's a savior that the program can be compiled in shorter time and minimal size compare to most of other languages, allow it to be packed and distributed quickly.\n\n## Go in Software Engineering\n\n\u003e Software engineering is what happens to programming when you add time and other programmers.-Russ Cox\n\nProgramming is hard. You have a problem, you write a program to solve it. Your program turns out great and works thing out - that's programming. But keeping your program work over time is struggling in many levels. More people coming, your business logic changes or some of your 3rd party library is no more working.\n\nSoftware Engineering is about keeping your program resilient over time. And Go was born to live by that code, with a firm promise that the program we wrote in day 1 will compile and run perfectly in the future. All of the language technical design and toolset that were made by the concern of Software Engineering aims to simpler the program, make it easier to maintain, coordinate and evolve.\n","title":"Go In Software Engineering","short_title":"","description":"An overview of Go's key features, including simplicity, concurrency support, and interface-driven OOP.

As Go pushes more type [composition over inheritance](https://go.dev/doc/faq#Is_Go_an_object-oriented_language), the POV on building 'unit' is different compare to other languages.\n\nIn Go, packages serve as the basic building blocks for creating **modular, reusable**, and maintainable software. Go's philosophy encourages developers to organize their code in a package-oriented way. \n\nTreat your packages as base units. This means that, from the outset, you should structure your project into reusable, well-encapsulated packages, each with a clear purpose.\n\n### Key concepts\n\n1. **Encapsulation and exporting**\n\nBy default, Go keeps all symbols (functions, variables, constants, types) within a package private unless they are explicitly exported. Exported symbols in Go start with an uppercase letter. This helps enforce encapsulation, exposing only what's necessary for external users while keeping the internal details hidden.\n    \nFor example:\n\n```go\n// This function is public and can be used outside the package.\nfunc Add(a, b int) int {\n    return a + b\n}\n\n// This function is private to the package.\nfunc subtract(a, b int) int {\n    return a - b\n}\n```\n    \n2. **Separation of concerns**    \n\nPackages should follow the principle of separation of concerns. Each package should serve a single purpose or set of related tasks. This makes the codebase more understandable and easier to maintain.\n    \nFor instance, if you're building a web server, you might separate concerns into different packages like:  \n- `http`: Handles HTTP requests and responses.\n- `router`: Manages routing of different endpoints.\n- `db`: Manages database interactions.\n\n3. **Directory structure**\nGo’s tooling is designed to work seamlessly with a package-oriented directory structure. Each directory contains its own package, which can be imported by other parts of your project.\n\nHere's an example directory structure:\n    \n```go\nmyproject/\n  ├── go.mod\n  ├── cmd/            // For command-line tools and executables\n  │   └── myapp/\n  │       └── main.go\n  ├── pkg/            // For libraries and reusable code\n  │   └── http/\n  │       └── handler.go\n  ├── internal/       // For non-public packages\n  │   └── config/\n  │       └── config.go\n  └── vendor/         // Third-party dependencies (if needed)\n```\n\n4. **Testing in packages**\n\nEach package should also contain its own unit tests, which are placed in the same directory as the package itself, following Go's testing framework. Test files are named with the `_test.go` suffix and can test both exported and internal functions of a package.\n    \nExample:\n    \n```go\n// In mathutil/add_test.go\npackage mathutil\n\nimport \"testing\"\n\nfunc TestAdd(t *testing.T) {\n    result := Add(2, 3)\n    if result != 5 {\n        t.Errorf(\"Expected 5, but got %d\", result)\n    }\n}\n```\n    \n5. **Modularity and reusability**\n\nBy structuring your code into distinct packages, you create **reusable** building blocks. These packages can be easily shared across different projects or within teams, and since Go’s import system relies on unique paths, there’s no conflict as long as each package’s import path is unique.\n\n### How to apply\n\nTo apply package-oriented development with a focus on reusability, follow these steps. Keeping reusability in mind from the start ensures your code is modular, maintainable, and adaptable for future projects.\n\nPlease take note that all below examples are to demonstrate the approach\n\n1. **Identify core domains and reusable utility needs**\n\n- **Define key Domains**: Break down the main areas of functionality (or domains) in your project, such as `users`, `orders`, or `products` for an e-commerce app.\n- **Identify reusable utilities**: List any generic functionalities, like string manipulation or date formatting, that multiple domains might need. Plan to create specific utility packages for these, separate from domain logic.\n\nExample Structure:\n\n```go\nmyproject/\n  ├── users/\n  ├── orders/\n  └── util/\n       ├── stringutil/\n       └── timeutil/\n```\n2. **Design each package to be self-contained and purpose-driven**\n\n- Each package should have a **single responsibility**, encapsulating everything it needs for its function. This approach makes it easier to reuse entire packages across projects.\n- Avoid mixing different concerns. A `users` package, for example, should contain everything about user management (e.g., types, validation, storage) without including unrelated functions.\n\nThis single responsibility design ensures that when you need similar functionality in another project, you can reuse the package without modification.\n\n3. **Create generalized, flexible functions**\n\n- When writing functions within a package, think about how they might be used in other contexts. Avoid overly specific parameters or hardcoded values that tie functions to one scenario.\n- For instance, instead of a `ValidateUserEmail` function, create a `ValidateEmail` function in a `validation` utility package, making it applicable to emails in any domain.\n\n4. **Use interfaces to decouple dependencies**\n\n- Define interfaces to allow flexible interactions between packages. Instead of directly calling functions from another package, define an interface in the calling package. This way, different implementations can be plugged in as needed.\n- For example, if `orders` needs data from `users`, create an interface in `orders` that describes only the needed methods, letting any `User` service that meets this interface be used.\n\n```go\n// orders/service.go\npackage orders\n\ntype UserFetcher interface {\n    GetUser(userID int) (User, error)\n}\n\ntype OrderService struct {\n    UserService UserFetcher\n}\n```\n\nUsing interfaces like this enhances reusability because each package relies on general contracts rather than specific implementations.\n\n5. **Structure utility packages for broad use**\n\n- Create focused utility packages that are purpose-driven and independent of specific domains. For instance, `stringutil` could contain generic string functions, while `timeutil` could handle time parsing and formatting.\n- Organizing utilities in this way makes them truly reusable across any project or domain.\n\nThis organization avoids the common “catch-all” `utils` package, promoting well-structured, reusable functions that don’t add unnecessary dependencies.\n\n6. **Document with reusability in mind**\n\n- Write clear documentation for each package, focusing on its purpose, its public API, and how to use it. Document with the mindset that another developer (or future you) may want to reuse it in a different context.\n- For utility functions, provide examples in the documentation to clarify their general use.\n\nThis documentation makes it easier for others to understand and adopt your package, increasing the likelihood of reuse.\n\n7. **Write independent unit tests for each package**\n\n- Write tests for each package that validate its functionality independently of the rest of the project. This not only ensures correctness but also supports reusability, as each package can be confidently reused without additional modification or testing.\n- Use test files (ending with `_test.go`) within each package and focus on testing each function’s behavior as if it were in a standalone environment.\n\n8. **Refactor with reusability in mind**\n\n- As you add features, continually review and refactor to ensure packages remain focused and reusable. If a package is accumulating functions that don’t belong, refactor those into new packages, keeping each package aligned with its single responsibility.\n\nPeriodic refactoring keeps packages easy to understand, maintain, and reuse, avoiding monolithic packages that are hard to untangle or apply to new contexts.\n\n----\n\n- **Code organization**: Dividing functionality into small, focused packages keeps the code clean and organized.\n- **Reusability**: Once written, a package can be reused in many projects or different parts of a large project.\n- **Maintainability**: With a well-structured package layout, code becomes easier to maintain, modify, and extend.\n- **Collaboration**: Teams can work on separate packages concurrently, as each package represents an independent unit of functionality.\n- **Testing and debugging**: Since each package is modular, testing becomes easier, and debugging issues can be done within the context of specific packages.\n","title":"Package first design","short_title":"","description":"In Go, packages serve as the basic building blocks for creating modular, reusable, and maintainable software.","tags":["go","package"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao"],"date":"Fri Oct 25 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/go/go-package.md","slugArray":["playground","go","go-package"]},{"content":"\nAt Dwarves Foundation, we host a few learning sessions to understand some of the technology around us. We regularly pick up topics we find interesting to dive deeper into to understand them better and present our findings. One topic that piqued my interest was the use of message brokers, due to how prevalent their use case is in our projects._\n\nIn today's digital world, the exchange of information between different systems and applications is becoming increasingly important. With the rise of cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a growing need for these systems to communicate with each other seamlessly. This is where message brokers come in. A message broker is a middleware solution that provides a platform for exchanging messages between applications, systems, and services. They act as intermediaries, ensuring that messages are delivered reliably and efficiently.\n\nWithout message brokers, communication between systems and applications would be much more difficult. They provide a common language that different systems can use to communicate with each other, regardless of the programming language or the hardware used. They also help to ensure that messages are delivered in the correct order, and can handle large volumes of messages without overwhelming the system.\n\n## What is a Message Broker?\n**A Message broker** is an intermediary program designed to validate, transform, and route messages. They serve the communication needs between applications.\n\nWith a Message broker, the source application (producer) sends a message to a server process that can provide data sorting, routing, message translation, persistence, and delivery to all appropriate destinations (consumers).\n\nThere are 2 basic forms of communication with a Message Broker:\n\n- Publish and Subscribe (Topics)\n\n![](assets/message-queues-and-streaming-platforms-eg-kafka-nats-rabbitmq_60a043f2ead4abd52c76f9fd47b0af68_md5.webp)\n\n- Point-to-Point (Queues)\n\n![](assets/message-queues-and-streaming-platforms-eg-kafka-nats-rabbitmq_56d936f810e3423ac48427e1d7ca3f64_md5.webp)\n\n## When and why to use Message Broker\nMessage brokers are versatile tools that can address a wide range of business needs across industries and in a variety of enterprise computing environments.\n\nHere are some common ways message brokers are used:\n\n- **E-commerce order processing and fulfillment:** If your business operates online, the reliability of your website and e-commerce platform is crucial to your brand's reputation. Message brokers are an excellent choice for processing online orders because they improve fault tolerance and ensure messages are consumed only once.\n- **Financial transactions and payment processing:** It's essential to ensure that payments are sent only once. Using a message broker to handle the data from these transactions ensures that payment information is not lost or accidentally duplicated, provides proof of receipt, and allows systems to communicate reliably even when intermediary networks are unavailable.\n- **Protecting highly sensitive data at rest and in transit:** If your industry is heavily regulated or your company faces significant security risks, it's important to choose a messaging solution that supports end-to-end encryption.\n\n### Topdev’s online CV creation example\nMessage Broker helps web servers to send responses to requests quickly instead of being forced to run a resource-consuming procedure on a system. Queuing messages is a good solution when we want to distribute messages to many recipients to reduce the load on processing workers.\n\nFor example, when users are allowed to create PDF files for IT CV templates from TopDev's online CV creation software, the problem is when thousands of users click on the \"create PDF\" button at the same time, the server receives many requests that will cause some problems such as slow response, overload, and even not being able to create a PDF file due to congestion. In this case, we need to use Message Broker to push these requests into a queue. The mechanism is as follows:\n\nA consumer takes a message from the queue and starts processing the PDF while a producer is adding new messages to the queue. A request can be created in one language and processed in another. The two applications exchange with each other through messages. Therefore, the sending and receiving applications will have low coupling.\n\n1. User sends a request to create a PDF on the web application.\n2. The web application (producer) sends a message to RabbitMQ containing the requested user data, such as name, email, phone number, etc.\n3. An exchange is agreed upon by the producer application and leads them to the right PDF creation queue.\n4. A PDF creation worker (consumer) receives a task and starts processing the PDF.\n\n![](assets/message-queues-and-streaming-platforms-eg-kafka-nats-rabbitmq_c17d6fd298e5729424b4b04d7cee315f_md5.webp)\n\n### Advantages and Disadvantages\nThere are a few advantages and disadvantages with a job request messaging on message brokers:\n\nAdvantages:\n\n- Loose coupling: the client can make a request without knowing about the other services. Therefore, it does not need to use a discovery mechanism to find the location of other service instances.\n- Message buffering: the broker is a buffer for messages until they are processed. This means that both sides do not need to be available at the same time for synchronous message exchange over HTTP (request/response protocol). Instead, the message is queued and is not processed until the consumer is ready. For example, an online store can accept orders even if the ordering service is slow or down because the orders are queued in the message broker and can be processed when the service is available again.\n- More flexible communication.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n- Potential performance bottleneck: the message broker could be a performance bottleneck. However, modern message brokers are designed for scalability.\n- Potential single point of failure: the message broker must be continuously accessible. However, modern message brokers are designed for high availability.\n- Additional operational complexity: the message broker is another component in a system that must be installed, configured, and maintained.\n\n## RabbitMQ\nRabbitMQ is a message broker that accepts and forwards messages, similar to a post office. When you put mail in a post box, you can be confident that the letter carrier will eventually deliver it to the recipient. RabbitMQ plays the roles of both the post box and post office, as well as the letter carrier.\n\nThe main difference between RabbitMQ and the post office is that RabbitMQ doesn't handle physical paper but instead accepts, stores, and forwards binary data called messages.\n\nRabbitMQ and messaging in general use some technical terms:\n\n- Producing means sending messages. A program that sends messages is called a **publisher(producer)**.\n- A producer sends messages to a **queue**, which is the equivalent of a post box in RabbitMQ. While messages flow through RabbitMQ and the applications, they can only be stored in a queue. A queue is limited by the host's memory and disk capacity and acts as a large message buffer. Many producers can send messages that go to a single queue, and many consumers can try to receive data from a single queue.\n- Consuming is similar to receiving. A **consumer** is a program that primarily waits to receive messages.\n- Between the publisher and queue, we also can put a component call **exchange **which has the main function to decide the message will go to which queues. I will explain more about that late.\n\n![](assets/message-queues-and-streaming-platforms-eg-kafka-nats-rabbitmq_173f812d33c4807b85a655a67c0dbc04_md5.webp)\n\n### Exchanges\n\nThe core idea in the messaging model in RabbitMQ is that the producer never sends any messages directly to a queue. In fact, the producer often does not even know if a message will be delivered to any queue at all.\n\nInstead, the producer can only send messages to an exchange. An exchange is a simple component that receives messages from producers on one side, and pushes them to queues on the other side. The exchange must know exactly what to do with a message it receives. Should it be routed to a specific queue or multiple queues, or should it be discarded? The rules for handling messages are defined by the exchange type.\n\n**Direct Exchange**\n\nThe function of Direct exchange is to push messages to the waiting queue based on the routing key. This direct exchange type is quite useful when you want to distinguish messages published to the same exchange by using a simple string identifier.\n\n**Fanout Exchange**\n\nThe function of Fanout exchange is to push messages to all queues attached to it. It is considered as a copy of the message sent to all queues regardless of any routing key. If it is registered, it will be ignored. This exchange is useful when we need to send data to multiple different devices with the same message but different processing at each device, each location.\n\n**Topic Exchange**\n\nTopic exchange will make a wildcard to match the routing key with a routing pattern declared in the binding. Consumers can register about topics they are interested in. The syntax used here is \\* and #.\n\n**Headers Exchange**\n\nA header exchange will use the header attributes of the message to route it. Headers Exchange is very similar to Topic Exchange but it routes based on header values instead of routing keys. A message is considered a match if the value of the header matches the value specified when bound.\n\n## Common Pattern\n### Work Queue - **Distributing tasks among workers**\n\n![](assets/message-queues-and-streaming-platforms-eg-kafka-nats-rabbitmq_59d782666f97eef826223c424dba2e03_md5.webp)\n\nThe main idea behind Work Queues (aka: Task Queues) is to avoid doing a resource-intensive task immediately and having to wait for it to complete. Instead we schedule the task to be done later. We encapsulate a task as a message and send it to a queue. A worker process running in the background will pop the tasks and eventually execute the job. When you run many workers the tasks will be shared between them.\n\nThis concept is especially useful in web applications where it's impossible to handle a complex task during a short HTTP request window.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n        \"context\"\n        \"log\"\n        \"os\"\n        \"strings\"\n        \"time\"\n\n        amqp \"github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go\"\n)\n\nfunc failOnError(err error, msg string) {\n        if err != nil {\n                log.Panicf(\"%s: %s\", msg, err)\n        }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n        conn, err := amqp.Dial(\"amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/\")\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to connect to RabbitMQ\")\n        defer conn.Close()\n\n        ch, err := conn.Channel()\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to open a channel\")\n        defer ch.Close()\n\n        q, err := ch.QueueDeclare(\n\t\t\t\t  \"task_queue\", // name\n\t\t\t\t  true,         // durable\n\t\t\t\t  false,        // delete when unused\n\t\t\t\t  false,        // exclusive\n\t\t\t\t  false,        // no-wait\n\t\t\t\t  nil,          // arguments\n\t\t\t\t)\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to declare a queue\")\n\n        ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)\n        defer cancel()\n\n        body := bodyFrom(os.Args)\n\t\t\t\terr = ch.PublishWithContext(ctx,\n\t\t\t\t  \"\",           // exchange\n\t\t\t\t  q.Name,       // routing key\n\t\t\t\t  false,        // mandatory\n\t\t\t\t  false,\n\t\t\t\t  amqp.Publishing {\n\t\t\t\t    DeliveryMode: amqp.Persistent,\n\t\t\t\t    ContentType:  \"text/plain\",\n\t\t\t\t    Body:         []byte(body),\n\t\t\t\t})\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to publish a message\")\n        log.Printf(\" [x] Sent %s\", body)\n}\n\nfunc bodyFrom(args []string) string {\n        var s string\n        if (len(args) \u003c 2) || os.Args[1] == \"\" {\n                s = \"hello\"\n        } else {\n                s = strings.Join(args[1:], \" \")\n        }\n        return s\n}\n```\n\nnew_task.go is responsible for sending messages to the RabbitMQ message queue. When a message is sent, it is marked with a routing key that indicates its priority. Messages with higher priority will be consumed by workers first. The program uses the amqp library to establish a connection to the RabbitMQ server, create a channel, declare a queue and publish messages to it.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n        \"bytes\"\n        \"log\"\n        \"time\"\n\n        amqp \"github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go\"\n)\n\nfunc failOnError(err error, msg string) {\n        if err != nil {\n                log.Panicf(\"%s: %s\", msg, err)\n        }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n        conn, err := amqp.Dial(\"amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/\")\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to connect to RabbitMQ\")\n        defer conn.Close()\n\n        ch, err := conn.Channel()\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to open a channel\")\n        defer ch.Close()\n\n        q, err := ch.QueueDeclare(\n\t\t\t\t  \"task_queue\", // name\n\t\t\t\t  true,         // durable\n\t\t\t\t  false,        // delete when unused\n\t\t\t\t  false,        // exclusive\n\t\t\t\t  false,        // no-wait\n\t\t\t\t  nil,          // arguments\n\t\t\t\t)\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to declare a queue\")\n\n        err = ch.Qos(\n                1,// prefetch count0,// prefetch sizefalse,// global\n        )\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to set QoS\"\n\n\t\t\t\tmsgs, err := ch.Consume(\n\t\t\t\t                q.Name, // queue\n\t\t\t\t                \"\",     // consumer\n\t\t\t\t                false,  // auto-ack\n\t\t\t\t                false,  // exclusive\n\t\t\t\t                false,  // no-local\n\t\t\t\t                false,  // no-wait\n\t\t\t\t                nil,    // args\n\t\t\t\t        )\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to register a consumer\")\n\n        var forever chan struct{}\n\n        go func() {\n                for d := range msgs {\n                        log.Printf(\"Received a message: %s\", d.Body)\n                        dotCount := bytes.Count(d.Body, []byte(\".\"))\n                        t := time.Duration(dotCount)\n                        time.Sleep(t * time.Second)\n                        log.Printf(\"Done\")\n                        d.Ack(false)\n                }\n        }()\n\n        log.Printf(\" [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C\")\n        \u003c-forever\n}\n```\n\nworker.go, on the other hand, is responsible for consuming messages from the queue and processing them. When a worker starts, it declares a queue and binds it to the exchange, specifying the routing key that it wants to consume. The worker then waits for messages from the queue and processes them one by one. In this tutorial, the processing time is simulated using the time.Sleep() function.\n\nIn the above example, we declare a queue with function:\n\n```go\nq, err := ch.QueueDeclare(\n  \"hello\",      // name\n  true,         // durable\n  false,        // delete when unused\n  false,        // exclusive\n  false,        // no-wait\n  nil,          // arguments\n)\n```\n\nFunction have params:\n\n1. `name`: The name of the queue to declare. It's a mandatory parameter and must be a string.\n1. `durable`: A boolean value that indicates if the queue should survive a broker restart or not. If `durable` is set to `true`, the queue will survive a broker restart, and if it's set to `false`, the queue will not.\n1. `delete when unused`: A boolean value that indicates if the queue should be deleted when it's no longer in use. If this is set to `**true**`, the queue will be deleted automatically when there are no more consumers subscribed to it.\n1. `exclusive`: A boolean value that indicates if the queue should be exclusive to the current connection. If this is set to `true`, only the current connection can access the queue. If set to `false`, other connections can also access the queue.\n1. `no-wait`: A boolean value that indicates if the queue should be declared as a passive queue or not. If this is set to `true`, the broker will not wait for a response from the server before sending the next command.\n1. `arguments`: A table of additional arguments to pass when declaring the queue. These arguments are optional and can be used to specify various queue properties such as message TTL (time-to-live), maximum length, and more.\n\nThe function returns the following values:\n\n1. `q`: The name of the queue that was declared by the broker. If the `name` parameter was empty, the broker will generate a unique name for the queue.\n1. `err`: An error value if there was an error declaring the queue. If the queue was declared successfully, `err` will be `nil`.\n\n### Publish/Subscribe - Sending messages to many consumers at once\n\nTo create Publish/Subscribe we need to:\n\n- create a fanout exchange and a queue\n- create relationship between exchange and a queue is called a binding\n\nThe producer program that emits log messages doesn't differ much from the previous part. The most significant change is that we now want to publish messages to our logs exchange instead of the nameless one. We need to supply a routingKey when sending, but its value is ignored for fanout exchanges. Here's the code for the emit_log.go script:\n\nemit_log.go\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n        \"context\"\n        \"log\"\n        \"os\"\n        \"strings\"\n        \"time\"\n\n        amqp \"github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go\"\n)\n\nfunc failOnError(err error, msg string) {\n        if err != nil {\n                log.Panicf(\"%s: %s\", msg, err)\n        }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n        conn, err := amqp.Dial(\"amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/\")\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to connect to RabbitMQ\")\n        defer conn.Close()\n\n        ch, err := conn.Channel()\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to open a channel\")\n        defer ch.Close()\n\n        err = ch.ExchangeDeclare(\n                \"logs\",   // name\n                \"fanout\", // type\n                true,     // durable\n                false,    // auto-deleted\n                false,    // internal\n                false,    // no-wait\n                nil,      // arguments\n        )\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to declare an exchange\")\n\n        ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)\n        defer cancel()\n\n        body := bodyFrom(os.Args)\n        err = ch.PublishWithContext(ctx,\n                \"logs\", // exchange\n                \"\",     // routing key\n                false,  // mandatory\n                false,  // immediate\n                amqp.Publishing{\n                        ContentType: \"text/plain\",\n                        Body:        []byte(body),\n                })\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to publish a message\")\n\n        log.Printf(\" [x] Sent %s\", body)\n}\n\nfunc bodyFrom(args []string) string {\n        var s string\n        if (len(args) \u003c 2) || os.Args[1] == \"\" {\n                s = \"hello\"\n        } else {\n                s = strings.Join(args[1:], \" \")\n        }\n        return s\n}\n```\n\nreceive_log.go\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n        \"log\"\n\n        amqp \"github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go\"\n)\n\nfunc failOnError(err error, msg string) {\n        if err != nil {\n                log.Panicf(\"%s: %s\", msg, err)\n        }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n        conn, err := amqp.Dial(\"amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/\")\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to connect to RabbitMQ\")\n        defer conn.Close()\n\n        ch, err := conn.Channel()\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to open a channel\")\n        defer ch.Close()\n\n        err = ch.ExchangeDeclare(\n                \"logs\",   // name\n                \"fanout\", // type\n                true,     // durable\n                false,    // auto-deleted\n                false,    // internal\n                false,    // no-wait\n                nil,      // arguments\n        )\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to declare an exchange\")\n\n        q, err := ch.QueueDeclare(\n                \"\",    // name\n                false, // durable\n                false, // delete when unused\n                true,  // exclusive\n                false, // no-wait\n                nil,   // arguments\n        )\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to declare a queue\")\n\n        err = ch.QueueBind(\n                q.Name, // queue name\n                \"\",     // routing key\n                \"logs\", // exchange\n                false,\n                nil,\n        )\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to bind a queue\")\n\n        msgs, err := ch.Consume(\n                q.Name, // queue\n                \"\",     // consumer\n                true,   // auto-ack\n                false,  // exclusive\n                false,  // no-local\n                false,  // no-wait\n                nil,    // args\n        )\n        failOnError(err, \"Failed to register a consumer\")\n\n        var forever chan struct{}\n\n        go func() {\n                for d := range msgs {\n                        log.Printf(\" [x] %s\", d.Body)\n                }\n        }()\n\n        log.Printf(\" [*] Waiting for logs.

In the same way, profiling is a useful way to catch all the problems in your code and ensure that it's running smoothly. It's a powerful tool that can help you identify and fix the subtle issues in your code quickly and efficiently.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore the world of profiling in Go and show you how you can use it to catch all the issues in your code.\n\n### Problem\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the problem we're facing. Check out this command:\n\n```bash\ngrep -wo love moby.txt | wc -l\n```\n\nThe above command counts the number of occurrences of the word love in a file named `moby.txt` (you can get the file here: https://gist.github.com/ktnyt/734e32aab75a4f7df06538dac9f00a5a).\n\nRun this command and we get a result of 24 (try it!). Next, create a file called `cmd.sh` to store the command above. The file should look like this:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\ngrep -wo love moby.txt | wc -l\n```\n\nNow we can time the entire command by running this:\n\n```bash\ntime ./cmd.sh\n```\n\nYou should get back something similar to this:\n\n```bash\n24\n./cmd.sh 0.03s user 0.01s system 101% cpu 0.039 total\n```\n\n0.039s - that was pretty fast! Now let's build something similar in Go. Run this command to set up Go modules:\n\n```bash\ngo mod init grep-clone\n```\n\nNext create a main.go file to write the code. Here's the Go implementation of the command we're trying to emulate:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n \"fmt\"\n \"io\"\n \"log\"\n \"os\"\n \"unicode\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n // read the args\n if len(os.Args) \u003c 2 {\n  log.Fatal(\"Not enough args\")\n }\n word := os.Args[1]\n file := os.Args[2]\n\n // open file\n f, err := os.Open(file)\n if err != nil {\n  log.Fatal(err)\n }\n defer f.Close()\n\n // count the number of occurrences\n count := 0\n curr := \"\"\n b := make([]byte, 1)\n for {\n  _, err := f.Read(b)\n  if err == io.EOF {\n   break\n  }\n  if err != nil {\n   log.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  if unicode.IsLetter(rune(b[0])) {\n   curr += string(b)\n  } else {\n   if curr == word {\n    count++\n   }\n   curr = \"\"\n  }\n }\n\n fmt.Println(count)\n}\n```\n\nAfter reading the arguments, we open the file, and then start counting the number of occurrences of the word by reading each byte from the file at a time. Whenever we encounter a non-character byte, we compare the current string with the target word. If they're the same, we increment the count variable by one. If not, we do nothing. We then reset the current string so that we can start building the next word. The for loop is exited only when we reach the end of the file, after which the result will be printed to stdout.\n\nNow let's time this program! But before that, we need to build the binary file. Run this command:\n\n```\ngo build .\n```\n\nYou should see a binary file named `grep-clone`. Why not just time it directly using go run? Why do we need to build the binary first? Because we only want to measure the run time of the application, excluding the build time.\n\nNow run this command:\n\n```bash\ntime ./grep-clone love moby.txt\n```\n\nYou should see this output:\n\n```bash\n24\n./grep-clone love moby.txt  0.26s user 0.51s system 100% cpu 0.764 total\n```\n\n0.764s - That's relatively slow compared to the original 0.039s.\n\nWhy is that? And what can be done to improve our program? You can try to come up with the answer yourself, or call up your senior programmer friends and discuss with them. Heck, you can even paste the entire program in ChatGPT and ask for help. But wait, there's a much simpler way: Profiling! That's what we're here for.\n\nThere are multiple type of profiling we can apply to our program. These include:\n\n- CPU Profile\n- Memory Profile (Heap)\n- Goroutine Profile\n- Allocation Profile\n- Thread Profile\n- Block Profile\n- Mutex Profile\n\nThe most commonly used types of profiling in Go are CPU profiling and memory profiling, which are also considered the most useful. We will only apply these two.\n\n### Solution\n\nGo already has a package for profiling call `pprof`, but let's use Dave Cheney's package for simplicity. Run this command:\n\n```bash\ngo get github.com/pkg/profile\n```\n\nNow let's modify the code. Add this line to the top of the main function:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n \"fmt\"\n \"io\"\n \"log\"\n \"os\"\n \"unicode\"\n\n \"github.com/pkg/profile\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n  defer profile.Start(profile.CPUProfile, profile.ProfilePath(\".\"), profile.NoShutdownHook).Stop()\n  //rest of the code\n}\n```\n\nThe line of code will generate a CPU profile file for us. Now let's rebuild the code:\n\n```bash\ngo build .\n```\n\nAnd then rerun the program:\n\n```bash\n./grep-clone love moby.txt\n```\n\nWhen we run the code again, it will generate a file named `cpu.pprof`. This file contains the information of the CPU profile of our program. Now let's use the go tool to analyze this file:\n\n```bash\ngo tool pprof cpu.pprof\n```\n\nNext enter top 10 to see the top 10 function calls that take up the most CPU time. You should see something like this:\n\n```\n(pprof) top 10\nShowing nodes accounting for 640ms, 100% of 640ms total\n      flat  flat%   sum%        cum   cum%\n     640ms   100%   100%      640ms   100%  syscall.syscall\n         0     0%   100%      640ms   100%  internal/poll.(*FD).Read\n         0     0%   100%      640ms   100%  internal/poll.ignoringEINTRIO (inline)\n         0     0%   100%      640ms   100%  main.main\n         0     0%   100%      640ms   100%  os.(*File).Read\n         0     0%   100%      640ms   100%  os.(*File).read (inline)\n         0     0%   100%      640ms   100%  runtime.main\n         0     0%   100%      640ms   100%  syscall.Read (inline)\n         0     0%   100%      640ms   100%  syscall.read\n```\n\nAs you can see, most of CPU time is spent running `syscall.syscall`. System calls take a lot of time to perform, so this is not ideal. Let's explore further:\n\n```\n(pprof) list main.main\nTotal: 640ms\nROUTINE ======================== main.main in /test/Projects/test/main.go\n         0      640ms (flat, cum)   100% of Total\n         .          .     13:func main() {\n         .          .     14:   defer profile.Start(profile.CPUProfile, profile.ProfilePath(\".\"), profile.NoShutdownHook).Stop()\n         .          .     15:\n         .          .     16:   // read the args\n         .          .     17:   if len(os.Args) \u003c 2 {\n         .          .     18:           log.Fatal(\"Not enough args\")\n         .          .     19:   }\n         .          .     20:   word := os.Args[1]\n         .          .     21:   file := os.Args[2]\n         .          .     22:\n         .          .     23:   // open file\n         .          .     24:   f, err := os.Open(file)\n         .          .     25:   if err != nil {\n         .          .     26:           log.Fatal(err)\n         .          .     27:   }\n         .          .     28:   defer f.Close()\n         .          .     29:\n         .          .     30:   // count the number of occurrences\n         .          .     31:   count := 0\n         .          .     32:   curr := \"\"\n         .          .     33:\n         .          .     34:   b := make([]byte, 1)\n         .          .     35:   for {\n         .      640ms     36:           _, err := f.Read(b)\n         .          .     37:           if err == io.EOF {\n         .          .     38:                   break\n         .          .     39:           }\n         .          .     40:           if err != nil {\n         .          .     41:                   log.Fatal(err)\n```\n\nWhen we explore the main function further by using the list command, we can see that the problem lies in line 36. Here, we are reading the file byte-by-byte, and each time we read a byte the program has to perform a system call to the OS. This is obviously not desirable, hence the need to reduce the number of system calls. Let's update the code:\n\n```go\n b := make([]byte, 1)\n r := bufio.NewReader(f)\n for {\n  _, err := r.Read(b)\n  if err == io.EOF {\n   break\n  }\n  if err != nil {\n   log.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  if unicode.IsLetter(rune(b[0])) {\n   curr += string(b)\n  } else {\n   if curr == word {\n    count++\n   }\n   curr = \"\"\n  }\n }\n```\n\nWe fix this by using a **buffered reader** in `bufio`. The buffer has a default size of 4096 bytes. This way, whenever we try to read a byte from the file, the program will actually read 4096 bytes at a time, store it in the memory, and then return the one byte to us. On subsequent read, the program will return the byte from the memory instead of fetching it all the way from disk. This will reduce the number of system calls needed.\n\nNow let's redo all of the above steps. Rebuild the code, rerun the program, then use pprof to examine the file again. When running `list main.main`, you should see something like this:\n\n```\n(pprof) list main.main\nTotal: 50ms\nROUTINE ======================== main.main in /test/Projects/test/main.go\n         0       40ms (flat, cum) 80.00% of Total\n         .          .     14:func main() {\n         .          .     15:   defer profile.Start(profile.CPUProfile, profile.ProfilePath(\".\"), profile.NoShutdownHook).Stop()\n         .          .     16:\n         .          .     17:   // read the args\n         .          .     18:   if len(os.Args) \u003c 2 {\n         .          .     19:           log.Fatal(\"Not enough args\")\n         .          .     20:   }\n         .          .     21:   word := os.Args[1]\n         .          .     22:   file := os.Args[2]\n         .          .     23:\n         .          .     24:   // open file\n         .          .     25:   f, err := os.Open(file)\n         .          .     26:   if err != nil {\n         .          .     27:           log.Fatal(err)\n         .          .     28:   }\n         .          .     29:   defer f.Close()\n         .          .     30:\n         .          .     31:   // count the number of occurrences\n         .          .     32:   count := 0\n         .          .     33:   curr := \"\"\n         .          .     34:\n         .          .     35:   b := make([]byte, 1)\n         .          .     36:   r := bufio.NewReader(f)\n         .          .     37:   for {\n         .       20ms     38:           _, err := r.Read(b)\n         .          .     39:           if err == io.EOF {\n         .          .     40:                   break\n         .          .     41:           }\n         .          .     42:           if err != nil {\n         .          .     43:                   log.Fatal(err)\n         .          .     44:           }\n         .          .     45:           if unicode.IsLetter(rune(b[0])) {\n         .       20ms     46:                   curr += string(b)\n         .          .     47:           } else {\n         .          .     48:                   if curr == word {\n         .          .     49:                           count++\n         .          .     50:                   }\n         .          .     51:                   curr = \"\"\n```\n\nFrom 640ms to 20ms! Looks like we've managed to reduce the number of system calls significantly. That is it for the CPU profiling. Now let's try to profile the memory instead. Change the code to this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n \"fmt\"\n \"io\"\n \"log\"\n \"os\"\n \"unicode\"\n\n \"github.com/pkg/profile\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n  defer profile.Start(profile.MemProfile, profile.ProfilePath(\".\"), profile.NoShutdownHook).Stop()\n  //rest of the code\n}\n```\n\nRebuild and then rerun the program. This time, you will see a file named `mem.pprof`. We examine this file in the same way:\n\n```bash\ngo tool pprof mem.pprof\n```\n\nList the main.main function again, this time you will see:\n\n```\n(pprof) list main.main\nTotal: 420.82kB\nROUTINE ======================== main.main in /Users/thomas/Projects/test/main.go\n  420.82kB   420.82kB (flat, cum)   100% of Total\n         .          .     14:func main() {\n         .          .     15:   defer profile.Start(profile.MemProfile, profile.ProfilePath(\".\"), profile.NoShutdownHook).Stop()\n         .          .     16:\n         .          .     17:   // read the args\n         .          .     18:   if len(os.Args) \u003c 2 {\n         .          .     19:           log.Fatal(\"Not enough args\")\n         .          .     20:   }\n         .          .     21:   word := os.Args[1]\n         .          .     22:   file := os.Args[2]\n         .          .     23:\n         .          .     24:   // open file\n         .          .     25:   f, err := os.Open(file)\n         .          .     26:   if err != nil {\n         .          .     27:           log.Fatal(err)\n         .          .     28:   }\n         .          .     29:   defer f.Close()\n         .          .     30:\n         .          .     31:   // count the number of occurrences\n         .          .     32:   count := 0\n         .          .     33:   curr := \"\"\n         .          .     34:\n         .          .     35:   b := make([]byte, 1)\n         .          .     36:   r := bufio.NewReader(f)\n         .          .     37:   for {\n         .          .     38:           _, err := r.Read(b)\n         .          .     39:           if err == io.EOF {\n         .          .     40:                   break\n         .          .     41:           }\n         .          .     42:           if err != nil {\n         .          .     43:                   log.Fatal(err)\n         .          .     44:           }\n         .          .     45:           if unicode.IsLetter(rune(b[0])) {\n  420.82kB   420.82kB     46:                   curr += string(b)\n         .          .     47:           } else {\n         .          .     48:                   if curr == word {\n         .          .     49:                           count++\n         .          .     50:                   }\n         .          .     51:                   curr = \"\"\n```\n\nLooks like we're allocating quite a lot of memory on line 46. To understand why, we need to look at the implementation of the string concatenation operation in Go. You can find it here: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/string.go\n\n```go\n// The constant is known to the compiler.\n// There is no fundamental theory behind this number.\nconst tmpStringBufSize = 32\n\ntype tmpBuf [tmpStringBufSize]byte\n\n// concatstrings implements a Go string concatenation x+y+z+...\n// The operands are passed in the slice a.\n// If buf != nil, the compiler has determined that the result does not\n// escape the calling function, so the string data can be stored in buf\n// if small enough.\nfunc concatstrings(buf *tmpBuf, a []string) string {\n idx := 0\n l := 0\n count := 0\n for i, x := range a {\n  n := len(x)\n  if n == 0 {\n   continue\n  }\n  if l+n \u003c l {\n   throw(\"string concatenation too long\")\n  }\n  l += n\n  count++\n  idx = i\n }\n if count == 0 {\n  return \"\"\n }\n\n // If there is just one string and either it is not on the stack\n // or our result does not escape the calling frame (buf != nil),\n // then we can return that string directly.\n if count == 1 \u0026\u0026 (buf != nil || !stringDataOnStack(a[idx])) {\n  return a[idx]\n }\n s, b := rawstringtmp(buf, l)\n for _, x := range a {\n  copy(b, x)\n  b = b[len(x):]\n }\n return s\n}\n```\n\nYou can read the code yourself to understand what it does. The problem lies in this function:\n\n```go\nfunc rawstringtmp(buf *tmpBuf, l int) (s string, b []byte) {\n if buf != nil \u0026\u0026 l \u003c= len(buf) {\n  b = buf[:l]\n  s = slicebytetostringtmp(\u0026b[0], len(b))\n } else {\n  s, b = rawstring(l)\n }\n return\n}\n```\n\nHere note that if the buf is nil, we will inevitably have to allocate new memory by calling the function rawstring. Here's the code of that function:\n\n```go\n// rawstring allocates storage for a new string. The returned\n// string and byte slice both refer to the same storage.\n// The storage is not zeroed. Callers should use\n// b to set the string contents and then drop b.\nfunc rawstring(size int) (s string, b []byte) {\n p := mallocgc(uintptr(size), nil, false)\n return unsafe.String((*byte)(p), size), unsafe.Slice((*byte)(p), size)\n}\n```\n\nSee the mallocgc call? It's allocating memory. Whether the buf is nil or not depends entirely on the compiler. This is something we don't have control of. Let's try to improve it by using a strings builder. Change the code to this:\n\n```go\n// count the number of occurrences\n count := 0\n var sb strings.Builder\n sb.Grow(32)\n\n b := make([]byte, 1)\n r := bufio.NewReader(f)\n for {\n  _, err := r.Read(b)\n  if err == io.EOF {\n   break\n  }\n  if err != nil {\n   log.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  if unicode.IsLetter(rune(b[0])) {\n   sb.Write(b)\n  } else {\n   if sb.String() == word {\n    count++\n   }\n   sb.Reset()\n   sb.Grow(32)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe logic is pretty much the same, only this time we're using a strings builder instead. The `sb.Grow(32)` is necessary because in order to avoid unnecessary resizing of the underneath slice, we need to pre-allocate some memory to contain the string. Removing this line will cause a lot of unnecessary allocation (you can try it out for yourself).\n\nNow rebuild and rerun the code. Examine the pprof file again, and you should see a significant improvement:\n\n```\n(pprof) list main.main\nTotal: 22.39kB\nROUTINE ======================== main.main in /test/Projects/test/main.go\n         0    22.39kB (flat, cum)   100% of Total\n         .          .     15:func main() {\n         .          .     16:   defer profile.Start(profile.MemProfile, profile.ProfilePath(\".\"), profile.NoShutdownHook).Stop()\n         .          .     17:\n         .          .     18:   // read the args\n         .          .     19:   if len(os.Args) \u003c 2 {\n         .          .     20:           log.Fatal(\"Not enough args\")\n         .          .     21:   }\n         .          .     22:   word := os.Args[1]\n         .          .     23:   file := os.Args[2]\n         .          .     24:\n         .          .     25:   // open file\n         .          .     26:   f, err := os.Open(file)\n         .          .     27:   if err != nil {\n         .          .     28:           log.Fatal(err)\n         .          .     29:   }\n         .          .     30:   defer f.Close()\n         .          .     31:\n         .          .     32:   // count the number of occurrences\n         .          .     33:   count := 0\n         .          .     34:   var sb strings.Builder\n         .          .     35:   sb.Grow(32)\n         .          .     36:\n         .          .     37:   b := make([]byte, 1)\n         .     6.33kB     38:   r := bufio.NewReader(f)\n         .          .     39:   for {\n         .          .     40:           _, err := r.Read(b)\n         .          .     41:           if err == io.EOF {\n         .          .     42:                   break\n         .          .     43:           }\n         .          .     44:           if err != nil {\n         .          .     45:                   log.Fatal(err)\n         .          .     46:           }\n         .          .     47:           if unicode.IsLetter(rune(b[0])) {\n         .          .     48:                   sb.Write(b)\n         .          .     49:           } else {\n         .          .     50:                   if sb.String() == word {\n         .          .     51:                           count++\n         .          .     52:                   }\n         .          .     53:                   sb.Reset()\n         .    16.06kB     54:                   sb.Grow(32)\n         .          .     55:           }\n         .          .     56:   }\n         .          .     57:\n         .          .     58:   fmt.Println(count)\n         .          .     59:}\n```\n\nIf you can't see anything, just rerun the program. Sometimes the allocation is so small the program is not able to capture the profile.\n\nThis is the final, improved version of our program:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n \"bufio\"\n \"fmt\"\n \"io\"\n \"log\"\n \"os\"\n \"strings\"\n \"unicode\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n // read the args\n if len(os.Args) \u003c 2 {\n  log.Fatal(\"Not enough args\")\n }\n word := os.Args[1]\n file := os.Args[2]\n\n // open file\n f, err := os.Open(file)\n if err != nil {\n  log.Fatal(err)\n }\n defer f.Close()\n\n // count the number of occurrences\n count := 0\n var sb strings.Builder\n sb.Grow(32)\n\n b := make([]byte, 1)\n r := bufio.NewReader(f)\n for {\n  _, err := r.Read(b)\n  if err == io.EOF {\n   break\n  }\n  if err != nil {\n   log.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  if unicode.IsLetter(rune(b[0])) {\n   sb.Write(b)\n  } else {\n   if sb.String() == word {\n    count++\n   }\n   sb.Reset()\n   sb.Grow(32)\n  }\n }\n\n fmt.Println(count)\n}\n```\n\nNote that I've removed the line of code that starts the profiling process. Profiling takes up CPU time as well, so after you're done, remember to remove it from your program!\n\nRebuild the program, and then time it again:\n\n```bash\ntime ./grep-clone love moby.txt\n```\n\nThis is the result:\n\n```bash\n24\n./grep-clone love moby.txt  0.03s user 0.01s system 98% cpu 0.043 total\n```\n\nLook at that! We've improved the runtime of our program significantly. This is the power of profiling: it shows you exactly where the problem is, so you know what to fix.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn conclusion, profiling is an essential tool for any Go developer looking to build high-quality and efficient applications. By catching all the performance problems in your code, you can optimize it for better performance, improving the user experience and overall success of your application. Whether you're working on a small personal project or a large enterprise application, profiling should be a regular part of your development process.\n\nAs you continue to work on your Go projects, keep in mind the importance of profiling and the various tools and techniques available to help you optimize your code. By doing so, you'll be well on your way to becoming a more efficient and effective developer.\n\nSo go ahead, catch 'em all!\n","title":"Profiling in Go","short_title":"","description":"Profiling in Go is a powerful tool that can help you identify and fix the subtle issues in your code quickly and efficiently.

Assigning one array to another copies all the elements.\n- In particular, if you pass an array to a function, it will receive a copy of the array, not a pointer to it.\n- The size of an array is part of its type. The types [4]int and [5]int are distinct.\n\nIn Go language, the terminology `Array` has a bit different from another language like C, JS, ... In Go, the `array has a fixed length and type `Take a look of array implementation in Go.\n\n![](assets/slice-and-array-in-golang_a650b13e6028a391f8acdc858b08c372_md5.webp)\n\nIts length is part of its type ([4]int and [5]int are distinct, incompatible types). For example, you can compare two arrays have the same type [4]int.\n\n```go\na := [4]int{1,1,1,1}\nb := [4]int{0,0,0,0}\nc := [4]int{}\n\nfmt.Println(a == b) // false\nfmt.Println(b == c) // true\nfmt.Println(c == a) // false\n```\n\nAs you can see, the array does not need to be initialized explicitly, the `array c` in the example above is initial with zero value of an array type (zero value of an integer is 0).\n\nBut two array [4]int and [5]int is incompatible with each other\n\n```go\na := [4]int{}\nb := [5]int{}\n\nfmt.Println(a == b) // mismatched types [4]int and [5]int\n```\n\nYou also can let Go's compiler count the array size for you at compile time.\n\n```go\na := [...]int{1,1,1}\nb := [3]int{1,1,1}\n\n// in this example, both a and b have a [3]int type and can compare with\n// each other\n\nfmt.Println(a == b) // true\n```\n\nFor representation for an array of [4]int in memory is for integer value laid out `sequentially`\n\n![](assets/slice-and-array-in-golang_8327bf995dd32badeef1e1d0eb4eeda5_md5.webp)\n\nSo, in Go, the array is values. An array variable holds the entire array (not a pointer to the first element). Let's say the array is a struct ( but using index instead of named field). Because an array is not a pointer to the first element, so when we assign, pass an array to a function, it will make a copy of its content\n\n### Slice\n\nIn Go code, we don't often see array because of its inflexible, slice - on the other hand - is everywhere. Slice is an abstraction built on top the array. Unlike the Array, Slice type has no specified length; you can declare a slice like an array but `without the count element`.\n\n```go\na := []int{1,2,3,4}\n```\n\nA slice has three components (will be talking more detail in next section):\n\n- `pointer` : point to underlying array\n- `length ` : the number of elements referred to by the slice\n- `capacity` : the number of elements in the underlying array\n\nBecause slices hold references to an underlying array, so if you assign one slice to another, both refer to the same array.\n\n```go\na := []int{1,2,3,4}\nb := a\nb[0] = 10\n\nfmt.Println(a) // [10 2 3 4]\n```\n\nWe can make a slice by using built-in `make` function. When called, `make` allocates an array and returns a slice that refers to that array. Note that the zero value of a slice is `nil.`\n\n```go\n// make(type, length[, capacity])\na := make([]int,4,8)\n\n// if we omit capacity, it defaults to the specified length\nb := make([]int,4)\n\n// len b = 4\n// capacity b = 4\n```\n\nor `slicing` an array or another slice using these format\n\n```go\na := []int{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\nb := a[0:5]\nfmt.Println(b) // [1 2 3 4 5]\n\nc := a[5:]\nfmt.Println(c) // [6 7 8 9 10]\n\nd := a[:5]\nfmt.Println(d) // [1 2 3 4 5]\n\ne := a[:]\nfmt.Println(e) // [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]\n```\n\nThe length and capacity of a slice can be inspected using the built-in `len` and `cap` functions.\n\n```go\na := make([]int,4, 8)\n\nfmt.Println(len(a)) // 4\nfmt.Println(cap(a)) // 8\n```\n\n### Slice internal\n\nLet's take a look at `slice` implementation in Go.\n\n```go\ntype slice struct{\n\tarray unsafe.Pointer\n\tlen int\n\tcap int\n}\n```\n\nFor example, if we create a slice by using make([]byte,5), the slice will be structured like this:\n\n![](assets/slice-and-array-in-golang_f18621d9bf057f8c2ea818ca438379c3_md5.webp)\n\nA slice cannot be grown beyond its capacity. Attempting to do so will cause a runtime panic, just as when indexing outside the bounds of a slice or array. Similarly, slices cannot be re-sliced below zero to access earlier elements in the array.\n\n**So the question is, What if we `*append*` an element to a slice which has reached its capacity?**\n\n### Append\n\nLet's dig into a source code (go/src/reflect/value)\n\n![](assets/slice-and-array-in-golang_1f1383e462f5fa432205e471759c4051_md5.webp)\n\nso the `append` built in function do a few things here:\n\nFirst, it will check an input value, if it's not a `Slice` the program will throw a panic, then the interesting things here is `grow` function , it will take an old slice and length of the new slice we want to append. Let take a look at `grow` function:\n\n![](assets/slice-and-array-in-golang_de7599e21a9ed4cf0e4a9d31169129e2_md5.webp)\n\nSo now we understand the mechanism behind the `append` function, it will allocate a `new Slice` which have more capacity than the old one\n\nThe interesting thing is how Go decide how much capacity the new slice is. As you can see if the old slice capacity is lesser than 1024, it will double the old slice's capacity, but when it grows bigger than 1024 Go adds `old slice's capacity / 4` to the old capacity\n\n### Appendix\n\n- [https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#slices](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#slices)\n- [https://blog.golang.org/slices](https://blog.golang.org/slices)\n","title":"Slice And Array In Golang","short_title":"","description":"An in-depth exploration of arrays and slices in Go, covering their differences, internal implementations, and key operations like append.

In this article, we will explore the techniques for crafting effective tests in Go, discussing best practices for writing unit tests and utilizing mocks to achieve better isolation. Although our primary focus lies in unit testing-related practices, it is important to note that Golang also supports integration testing. We will also tackle the subject of integration testing in a future article, where we will examine the details and best practices for integration testing in Golang.\n\n## Introduction\n### Importance of testing in software development\n\nTesting is crucial in software development to catch bugs and errors, ensure maintainability and modularity, and improve security, and overall software quality. With the rise of cybersecurity threats, testing is becoming increasingly important to ensure software systems are secure and reliable.\n\nWhat follows is a non-comprehensive list of the benefits you get from adopting unit testing:\n\n- **Unit tests enable earlier bug detection and resolution**\n- **Your suite of unit tests becomes a safety net for developers**\n\nA comprehensive suite of unit tests can act as a safety net for developers. By frequently running the tests, they can assure their recent modifications to the code haven’t broken anything\n\n- Unit tests can contribute to higher code quality\n\nThis item is a natural consequence of the previous one. Since unit tests act as a safety net, developers become more confident when changing the code. They can refactor the code without fear of breaking things, driving the general quality of the codebase up.\n\n- **Detect code smells in your codebase**\n\nIf the ease of adding unit tests to a codebase is a good sign, the opposite is also true. Having a hard time creating unit tests for a given piece of code might be a sign of code smells in the code—e.g. functions that are too complex.\n\n### Overview of Golang Testing Framework\n\nThe Golang testing package offers a user-friendly framework to create unit tests, benchmarks, and examples, streamlining the development process in Golang by enabling execution from the command line. Package testing allows for a variety of test types, including performance, parallel, and functional testing, as well as any combination these.\n\n**Steps for writing test suite in Golang:**\n\n- Create a file whose name ends with \\_test.go\n- Import package testing by import “testing” command\n- Write the test function of form\\ \u003cu\u003efunc TestXxx(_testing.T)_\u003c/u\u003e which uses any of Error, Fail, or related methods to signal failure.\n- Put the file in any package.\n- Run command go test\n\nExample of a test file:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"testing\"\n)\n\n// test function\nfunc TestYourFunc(t *testing.T) {\n\tactualString := YourFunc()\n\texpectedString := \"dwarvesv\"\n\tif actualString != expectedString{\n\t\tt.Errorf(\"Expected String(%s) is not same as\"+\n\t\t\" actual string (%s)\", expectedString,actualString)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Strategies for Writing Effective Tests\n\n### Make your code testable and easy to test\n\nWhen working on code projects, developers often devote a large portion of their time to choosing the right frameworks, libraries, databases, and other third-party components, while the importance of testing is sometimes overlooked.\n\nProper testing actually makes your project better because it encourages you to:\n\n- Apply clean code: write short functions, handle a single task per function, etc.\n- Write extendable and agnostic code through the use of abstractions, interfaces and mocks.\n- Understand the business logic better by testing regular/edge cases and high coverage of these.\n- Avoid legacy, long-untouched and unmaintainable code — tests will ease the process of maintaining and verifying changes to code so it doesn’t rot.\n\n### Writing clear and concise test cases\n\nOne of the most important of a good test is easy to read and maintain, it should be taken in mind as important as implementing:\n\n**Naming test case** The name of your test should consist of three parts:\n\n- The name of the method being tested.\n- The scenario under which it's being tested.\n- The expected behavior when the scenario is invoked.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Bad naming: `Error 1`, `invalid input 1`, `test 1`\n- Good naming: `Should returns same number WHEN input single number`, `Should returns 0 WHEN emtpy string`\n\n**Table driven testing** A test can quickly become unreadable, repetitive, and overall annoying when the function you want to test is handling too many tasks, especially when there are many different cases you want to test, for example:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n   \"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert\"\n   \"testing\"\n)\n\nfunc TestHadAGoodGame(t *testing.T) {\n   tests := []struct {\n      name     string\n      stats   Stats\n      goodGame bool\n      wantErr  string\n   }{\n      {\"sad path: invalid stats\", Stats{Name: \"Sam Cassell\",\n         Minutes: 34.1,\n         Points: -19,\n         Assists: 8,\n         Turnovers: -4,\n         Rebounds: 11,\n         }, false, \"stat lines cannot be negative\",\n      },\n      {\"happy path: good game\", Stats{Name: \"Dejounte Murray\",\n         Minutes: 34.1,\n         Points: 19,\n         Assists: 8,\n         Turnovers: 4,\n         Rebounds: 11,\n      }, true, \"\"},\n   }\n   for _, tt := range tests {\n      isAGoodGame, err := hadAGoodGame(tt.stats)\n      if tt.wantErr != \"\" {\n         assert.Contains(t, err.Error(), tt.wantErr)\n      } else {\n         assert.Equal(t, tt.goodGame, isAGoodGame)\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\n### Use Interfaces and Avoid file I/O, API call\n\nWhen writing tests, it's important to use interfaces and avoid file I/O and API calls wherever possible. You want your tests to be fast, independent, isolated, consistent, and not flaky. Here are some best practices to keep in mind:\n\n**Use interfaces** By using interfaces, you can decouple your code from its dependencies, making it easier to test in isolation. Instead of calling concrete implementations, you can call interfaces that define the behavior you need, for example:\n\n```go\ntype repository interface {\n  GetRecipe(recipeID string) (domain.Recipe, error)\n  CreateRecipe(recipe domain.Recipe) error\n  UpdateRecipe(recipe domain.Recipe) error\n}\n```\n\n**Mock dependencies** To test code that relies on external dependencies, use mocks to simulate the behavior of those dependencies. This approach allows you to test your code in isolation, without relying on external resources.\n\n```go\nimport (\n    \"testing\"\n\n    \"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert\"\n)\n\nfunc Test_getFromDB(t *testing.T) {\n    mockDB := NewMockDB(t)\n\t\tmockDB.On(\"GetFlavor\").Return(\"Chocolate\", nil)\n    flavor := getFromDB(mockDB)\n    assert.Equal(t, \"chocolate\", flavor)\n}\n```\n\n**Avoid file I/O**\n\nFile I/O can be slow and unreliable, making it difficult to test code that relies on it. Instead, consider using interfaces to abstract away file I/O and using mocks to simulate file operations during testing.\n\n```go\nfunc Test_getFromDB(t *testing.T) {\n\t\tmockReader := reader.NewMock()\n\t\tmockReader.On(\"Read\", mock.Anything).Return(100, nil)\n    scanSvc := scan.NewInstance(mockReader)\n\n\t\texpectedSize := 100\n    assert.Equal(t, scan.size(), expectedSize)\n}\n```\n\n**Avoid API calls** Like file I/O, API calls can be slow and unreliable, making it difficult to test code that relies on them. Instead, consider using interfaces to abstract away API calls and using mocks to simulate API responses during testing.\n\n```go\nfunc Test_AcceptJobRequest(t *testing.T) {\n\t\tmockEmailGwy := new(email.MockGateway)\n\t\tmockEmailGwy.On(\"SendEmailWithTemplate\", mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(nil)\n\n\t\tworkerCtrl := worker.New(mockEmailGwy)\n\t\terr := workerCtrl.acceptAndNotify()\n\t\t// Some asserts here\n}\n```\n\n### Covering edge cases and boundary conditions\n\nAs we all know, this is a basic test strategy, but this reveals most of the potential bugs. Because humans usually break the rule, and that would break the happy flow. It's important to cover edge cases and boundary conditions to ensure that your code can handle extreme or unexpected values. Here are some tips for covering edge cases and boundary conditions in your tests:\n\n- **Test extreme values**: Be sure to test extreme values, such as the maximum and minimum values that your code can handle.\n- **Test unexpected input**: Be sure to test any weird input values or characters that might look like it would affect the test.\n- **Test corner cases**: Be sure to test corner cases, such as scenarios where multiple inputs or conditions intersect. This approach can help you catch issues with complex logic or interactions between different parts of your code.\n\n## Test coverage\n\nTest coverage is defined as a metric in Software Testing that measures the amount of testing performed by a set of tests. It will include gathering information about which parts of a program are executed when running the test suite to determine which branches of conditional statements have been taken.\n\nIn simple terms, it is a technique to ensure that your tests are testing your code or how much of your code you exercised by running the test.\n\n- **Very Poor: 0-20% coverage**. This means that very few or no unit tests have been written to test the code, which can result in bugs and errors going unnoticed.\n- **Poor: 21-40% coverage**. This means that some unit tests have been written, but a significant amount of code remains untested.\n- **Acceptable: 41-60% coverage**. This means that a reasonable number of unit tests have been written to test the code, but there is still room for improvement.\n- **Good: 61-80% coverage**. This means that a large percentage of the code has been covered by unit tests, and most potential bugs and errors have been caught.\n- **Very Good: 81-100% coverage**. This means that almost all code has been covered by unit tests, and the likelihood of bugs and errors slipping through is very low. However, achieving 100% coverage may not always be practical or necessary, depending on the nature and complexity of the code.\n\nAlthough it depends on the project's status, ideally, we recommend aiming for a test coverage between **61-80%**. However, don't become obsessed with the number; the primary goal is to write tests that help us catch bugs effectively.\n\n## Tooling and library\n\nGolang possesses a robust testing framework; however, employing supplementary tools can enhance the development experience and reduce code creation efforts.\n\n- **Mocking**: Rather than creating mock code manually, consider utilizing a mocking library, such as gomock or mockery, which supports mocking and generates mocks from interfaces, thereby reducing time expenditure.\n- **Assert**: The default Golang testing framework has limited assertion capabilities. Alternatively, tools like testify provide improved support and more user-friendly assertions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we've covered the basics of testing in Golang and explored some strategies for writing effective and maintainable tests. We've seen best practices for using interfaces, avoiding file I/O and API calls, automating unit tests, and covering edge cases and boundary conditions.\n\nBy following these strategies and best practices, you can write tests that are easier to run, understand, and maintain. By investing time in testing, you can catch bugs and errors earlier in the development process, which can save time and improve the overall quality of your code.\n\nRemember, testing is not a one-time task but an ongoing process that should be integrated into your development workflow. With the right tools, frameworks, and mindset, testing can become a natural and valuable part of your development process, helping you build more reliable and maintainable software.\n\n## References\n\n[Overview of testing package in Golang](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overview-of-testing-package-in-golang/)\n\n[5 tips for better unit testing in golang](https://blog.devgenius.io/5-tips-for-better-unit-testing-in-golang-b25f9e79885a)\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-best-practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-best-practices)\n\n[https://www.testim.io/blog/unit-testing-best-practices/](https://www.testim.io/blog/unit-testing-best-practices/)\n\n[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-guide-to-testing-implement-these-quick-checks-to-test-your-code-d50027ad5eed/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-guide-to-testing-implement-these-quick-checks-to-test-your-code-d50027ad5eed/)\n\n[https://testing.googleblog.com/2020/08/code-coverage-best-practices.html](https://testing.googleblog.com/2020/08/code-coverage-best-practices.html)\n","title":"Unit Testing Best Practices In Golang","short_title":"","description":"An in-depth exploration of arrays and slices in Go, covering their differences, internal implementations, and key operations like append.

News, discount news, film ticket, etc are some examples of crawl. To be simple, it is analytics HTML, read cards, and extract data. The Go library I usually use is [goquery](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery).\n\nHowever, crawling an original HTML will not work in some cases: data loaded by ajax (when reading HTML, we will only see wrapper, not data), or must login when entering a page need crawl.\n\nIn this article, take crawling [Amazon deal](https://www.amazon.com/gp/goldbox/all-deals/ref=gbps_ftr_s-3_3022_wht_541966?ie=UTF8\u0026*Version*=1\u0026*entries*=0\u0026gb_f_GB-SUPPLE=sortOrder%3ABY_SCORE%2CenforcedCategories%3A3760911%2C2335752011%2C541966\u0026pf_rd_p=2292853022\u0026pf_rd_s=slot-3\u0026pf_rd_t=701\u0026pf_rd_i=gb_all\u0026pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER\u0026pf_rd_r=14CQSB5TF4GTC2RNHDAG) into consideration. In this page, javascript will call ajax taking data and then pour it into DOM. When using goquery read HTML, we will not see div cards like inspecting elements.\n\nTo these types, I use selenium to run the web in a real browser, take action to have fully loaded HTML before extracting data.\n\nSelenium running in JVM is quite famous in automation test. It allows me to run script test in a real browser. My method will be: Use selenium to run the Amazon page, wait for javascript to load, and then crawl the data normally.\n\n## How to setup\n\nFirstly, you go to [seleniumhq](https://selenium.dev/downloads/) link to download and set up seleniumhq. Selenium plays a role like a server, receiving requests sent from my code Go.\n\nTo run it, we go to the folder containing file jar and run the command:\n\n```plain_text\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.50.1.jar -port 8081\n```\n\n![](assets/use-go-selenium-to-crawl-data_79536b2784ffffd405fdcbd54b56927f_md5.webp)\n\n\\=\u003e We have server selenium running at port 8081. Next, you pull Go-selenium in by Go get:\n\n```javascript\ngo get sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/go-selenium\n```\n\nAfter that, we need to set up a browser. I choose Firefox. Remember, when running locally, we only need to set up Firefox on the web. In contrast, running on the host we need to set up Firefox by Shell script. You can refer to [how to set up Selenium on Ubuntu 14.04](https://gist.github.com/curtismcmullan/7be1a8c1c841a9d8db2c) Done! Now let’s code.\n\nWe need:\n\n- Remote to server selenium\n- Access to Amazon deal link\n- Conduct analytics HTLM to get information. I will print page title and the image of the first product\n\n```javascript\nfunc main() {\n    var webDriver selenium.WebDriver\n    var err error\n    // set browser as firefox\n    caps := selenium.Capabilities(map[string]interface{}{\"browserName\": \"firefox\"})\n    // remote to selenium server\n    if webDriver, err = selenium.NewRemote(caps, \"http://localhost:8081/wd/hub\"); err != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Failed to open session: %s\\n\", err)\n        return\n    }\n    defer webDriver.Quit()\n\n    err = webDriver.Get(URL_AMAZON_DEAL)\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Failed to load page: %s\\n\", err)\n        return\n    }\n    // sleep for a while for fully loaded javascript\n    time.Sleep(4 * time.Second)\n    // get title\n    if title, err := webDriver.Title(); err == nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Page title: %s\\n\", title)\n    } else {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Failed to get page title: %s\", err)\n        return\n    }\n\n    var elem selenium.WebElement\n    elem, err = webDriver.FindElement(selenium.ByCSSSelector, \"#widgetContent\")\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Failed to find element: %s\\n\", err)\n        return\n    }\n\n    var firstElem selenium.WebElement\n    firstElem, err = elem.FindElement(selenium.ByCSSSelector, \".a-section .dealContainer\")\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Failed to find element: %s\\n\", err)\n        return\n    }\n    // get image\n    image, err := firstElem.FindElement(selenium.ByCSSSelector, \"img\")\n    if err == nil {\n        img, _ := image.GetAttribute(\"src\")\n        fmt.Println(img)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRun the code, we have\n\n```javascript\nPage title: Gold Box Deals | Today's Deals - Amazon.com\nhttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51eU5JrGAXL.\\_AA210\\_.jpg\n```\n\nWell, we got all the needed information.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAbove is my knowledge when having problems with crawl in developing software. Here is Go software programming language. Selenium also helps us in other cases, like pages need login, web pages request captcha, etc. If anyone has other experiences, I hope to hear from you.\n","title":"Use Go Selenium To Crawl Data","short_title":"","description":"Learn how to use Go with Selenium to crawl dynamic web pages, overcoming challenges like AJAX-loaded content and login requirements.

These are work-in-progress release notes. Go 1.24 is expected to be released in February 2025.\n\n- Fully supports *generic type aliases*: a type alias may be parameterized like a defined type\n\n```go\ntype (\n\tnodeList = []*Node  // nodeList and []*Node are identical types\n\tPolar    = polar    // Polar and polar denote identical types\n)\n```\n\n  =\u003e Specs:\n\n```go\ntype set[P comparable] = map[P]bool\ntype A[P any] = P    // illegal: P is a type parameter\n```\n\n  =\u003e the feature can be disabled by setting `GOEXPERIMENT=noaliastypeparams`; but the `aliastypeparams` setting will be removed for Go 1.25.\n\n- Some updates for tools `go tool` or `-tool` flag, new `tests` analyzer for `go vet`\n\n- Some updates for Cgo, Runtime, Compiler, Linker, Bootstrap\n\n- Some updates for stdlibs:\n\n  - The new `os.Root` type provides the ability to perform filesystem operations within a specific directory.\n\n  - The `os.OpenRoot` function opens a directory and returns an `os.Root`. Methods on `os.Root` operate within the directory and do not permit paths that refer to locations outside the directory, including ones that follow symbolic links out of the directory.\n\n    `os.Root.Open` opens a file for reading.\n\n    `os.Root.Create` creates a file.\n\n    `os.Root.OpenFile` is the generalized open call.\n\n    `os.Root.Mkdir` creates a directory.\n\n  - Some updates for `crypto`, `hash` package\n\n  - Some updates for `net/http` including support for HTTP/2 protocol settings in `Transport` and `Server`\n\n  - New implementation for `sync.Map` that will improve overall performance and resolve some long-standing issues\n\n\n## [Weak Pointers in Go: Why They Matter Now](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/go-weak-pointer/)\n\n### Definition:\n\nA type of reference to an object that does not prevent the object from being garbage collected\n\n=\u003e `weak` package:\n\n```go\ntype Pointer[T any] struct {\n\tu unsafe.Pointer\n}\n\n// Make creates a weak pointer from a strong pointer to some value of type T.\nfunc Make[T any](ptr *T) Pointer[T] {\n  //...\n}\n```\n\n- If the memory they’re pointing to gets cleaned up, the weak pointer automatically becomes `nil` — so there’s no risk of accidentally pointing to freed memory =\u003e they are safe\n\n```go\ntype T struct {\n  a int\n  b int\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n  a := new(string)\n  println(\"original:\", a)\n\n  // make a weak pointer\n  weakA := weak.Make(a)\n\n  runtime.GC()\n\n  // use weakA\n  strongA := weakA.Strong()\n  println(\"strong:\", strongA, a)\n\n  runtime.GC()\n\n  // use weakA again\n  strongA = weakA.Strong()\n  println(\"strong:\", strongA)\n}\n\n// Output:\n// original: 0x1400010c670\n// strong: 0x1400010c670 0x1400010c670\n// strong: 0x0\n```\n\n- After the first garbage collection `runtime.GC()`, the weak pointer weakA still points to the memory because we’re still using the variable a in the `println(\"strong:\", strongA, a)` line. The memory can’t be cleaned up yet since it’s in use.\n- But when the second garbage collection runs, the strong reference (a) isn’t used anymore. That means the garbage collector can safely clean up the memory, leaving `weakA.Strong()` to return `nil`.\n\n### Use case\n\n- Canonicalization maps, where you only want to keep one copy of a piece of data around \n- Initial purpose is in internal packages, e.g: `unique`\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n\th1 := unique.Make(\"Hello\")\n\th2 := unique.Make(\"Hello\")\n\tw1 := unique.Make(\"World\")\n\n\tfmt.Println(\"h1:\", h1)\n\tfmt.Println(\"h2:\", h2)\n\tfmt.Println(\"w1:\", w1)\n\tfmt.Println(\"h1 == h2:\", h1 == h2)\n\tfmt.Println(\"h1 == w1:\", h1 == w1)\n}\n\n// Output:\n// h1: {0x14000090270}\n// h2: {0x14000090270}\n// w1: {0x14000090280}\n// h1 == h2: true\n// h1 == w1: false\n```\n\n### How does it work\n\n- Having a in-between tiny object (8bytes)\n\n![](assets/weak-pointer-indirection-reference.webp)\n\n- This setup lets the garbage collector clean up weak pointers to a specific object all at once, efficiently: \n  - the collector only needs to set the pointer in the indirection object to nil (or 0x0). No need to go around updating each weak pointer individually.\n\n![](assets/weak-pointer-gc-reclaim.webp)\n\n---\n\nhttps://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.24\n\nhttps://victoriametrics.com/blog/go-weak-pointer/  ","title":"Go Commentary #23: Draft Release Notes for Go 1.24 and weak pointers in Go","short_title":"#23 Draft Release Notes for Go 1.24 and weak pointers in Go","description":"Draft Release Notes for Go 1.24 and the incoming of weak pointers in Go","tags":["golang","go-weekly"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["fuatto"],"date":"Fri Dec 06 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/go/weekly/dec-06.md","slugArray":["playground","go","weekly","dec-06"]},{"content":"\n## [Coming in Go 1.24: testing/synctest experiment for time and concurrency testing](https://danp.net/posts/synctest-experiment/)\n\n### Context\n\n```go\nfunc Test(t *testing.T) {\n    before := time.Now()\n    time.Sleep(time.Second)\n    after := time.Now()\n    if d := after.Sub(before); d != time.Second {\n        t.Fatalf(\"took %v\", d)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- Traditional hack\n\n```go\nfunc Test(t *testing.T) {\n    before := time.Now()\n    time.Sleep(time.Second)\n    after := time.Now()\n    if d := after.Sub(before); d \u003e= 2*time.Second {\n        t.Fatalf(\"took %v\", d)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- It's still flaky because it depends on the system clock.\n\n\n\n### Solution\n\n- The `testing/synctest` package is an experiment to provide a more deterministic way to test time and concurrency in Go.\n\n```go\nimport (\n\t\"testing\"\n\t\"testing/synctest\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\nfunc Test(t *testing.T) {\n\tsynctest.Run(func() {\n\t\tbefore := time.Now()\n\t\ttime.Sleep(time.Second)\n\t\tafter := time.Now()\n\t\tif d := after.Sub(before); d != time.Second {\n\t\t\tt.Fatalf(\"took %v\", d)\n\t\t}\n\t})\n}\n```\n\n- And then use [gotip](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/dl/gotip) with `GOEXPERIMENT=synctest`\n\n### Extending to concurrency\n\n```go\nfunc Test(t *testing.T) {\n\tctx := context.Background()\n\n\tctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)\n\n\tvar hits atomic.Int32\n\tgo func() {\n\t\ttick := time.NewTicker(time.Millisecond)\n\t\tdefer tick.Stop()\n\t\tfor {\n\t\t\tselect {\n\t\t\tcase \u003c-ctx.Done():\n\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\tcase \u003c-tick.C:\n\t\t\t\thits.Add(1)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}()\n\n\ttime.Sleep(3 * time.Millisecond)\n\tcancel()\n\n\tgot := int(hits.Load())\n\tif want := 3; got != want {\n\t\tt.Fatalf(\"got %v, want %v\", got, want)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n- It's flaky because of the initial delay of the Ticker\n\n- Wrap the test in `synctest.Run` to make it deterministic\n\n```go\nfunc Test(t *testing.T) {\n\tsynctest.Run(func() {\n\t\tctx := context.Background()\n\n\t\tctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)\n\n\t\tvar hits atomic.Int32\n\t\tgo func() {\n\t\t\ttick := time.NewTicker(time.Millisecond)\n\t\t\tdefer tick.Stop()\n\t\t\tfor {\n\t\t\t\tselect {\n\t\t\t\tcase \u003c-ctx.Done():\n\t\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\t\tcase \u003c-tick.C:\n\t\t\t\t\thits.Add(1)\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}()\n\n\t\ttime.Sleep(4 * time.Millisecond)\n\t\tcancel()\n\n\t\tgot := int(hits.Load())\n\t\tif want := 3; got != want {\n\t\t\tt.Fatalf(\"got %v, want %v\", got, want)\n\t\t}\n\t})\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- It seems that `testing/synctest` will significantly improve testing code that involves time or concurrency. Example in go source: [https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/630382](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/630382)\n\n- You can try it yourself now by using `gotip` and setting `GOEXPERIMENT=synctest`. When Go 1.24 comes out GOEXPERIMENT=synctest will still be required.\n\n- Review the [main proposal](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/67434) and share any experience you have.\n\n---\n\nhttps://danp.net/posts/synctest-experiment/\n\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/630382\n\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/67434","title":"Go Commentary #24: Coming in Go 1.24: testing/synctest experiment for time and concurrency testing","short_title":"#24 Go 1.24 testing/synctest experiment for time and concurrency testing","description":"Go 1.24 testing/synctest experiment for time and concurrency testing","tags":["golang","go-weekly"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["fuatto"],"date":"Fri Dec 13 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/go/weekly/dec-13.md","slugArray":["playground","go","weekly","dec-13"]},{"content":"\n\n## [Why People are Angry over Go 1.23 Iterators](https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2024/06/17/go-iterator-design/)\n\n- Context:\n    - Most languages provide standardized way to iterate over values stored in [containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(abstract_data_type)).\n    \n- Problem:\n\n    - Go has `for` `range` for maps, slices, strings, arrays and channels but no generic mechanism for user-written containers.\n\n    - Short list of some non-generic iterators:\n        - *runtime.CallersFrames*: returns `runtime.Frames` iterates over stack frames; `Frames` has a `Next` method and a bool to check if there are more frames.\n\n        - *bufio.Scanner*: iterates through an `io.Reader`; `Scan` method advances to the next value, `Bytes` method to return the value and `Err` to return error.\n\n        - *database/sql.Rows*: iterates through the results of a query; also has `Scan` method.\n    \n    - Before Generics were introduced, no way to write an interface that described an iterator that would cover all of the use cases...\n\n- Solution:\n\n    - Go 1.22 proposal of adding package `iter` can range over integers and functions:\n\n    ```go\n    type (\n\t    Seq[V any]     func(yield func(V) bool) bool\n\t    Seq2[K, V any] func(yield func(K, V) bool) bool\n    )\n    ```\n    (Seq2 represents a sequence of paired values: key-value, index-value or value-error)\n    \n    - An iterator is a function that passes successive elements of a sequence to a callback function `yield`, it returns true if it should continue, false if it should stop.\n\n    ```go\n    type (\n        Yield[V any] func(V bool)\n        Yield2[K, V any] func(K,V) bool\n    )\n    ```\n\n    - Examples:\n\n    ```go\n    func Backward[E any](s []E) func(func(int, E) bool) {\n        return func(yield func(int, E) bool) {\n            for i := len(s)-1;

(The author did try Rust but too hard to understand)\n\n- Problems:\n\n  - If you use `curl` to send the requests (0.5s per request) 1 by 1 from single machine =\u003e 7.9 years.\n\n  - Data transfer perspective (not that much):\n\n    - 500 million requests \\* 1 KB (average request size) ≈ 478 GB\n    - 500 million responses \\* 5 KB (average response size) ≈ 2.33 TB\n\n  - Break down what HTTP client does in each call:\n\n  ```go\n  resp, err := http.Get(\"https://example.com\")\n  ```\n\n        1. Resolve DNS\n        2. TCP connect to another machine\n        3. TLS handshake (generate and exchange cryptographic keys)\n        4. Prepare HTTP request to send (normalize, encode)\n        5. Wait for response and read it\n        6. Parse response (decode, normalize and parse)\n        7. Close connection (optional)\n\n  - Measured results of sending HTTP/1.1 requests to subdomains of `*.wordpress.com` (wordpress.com has [wildcard dns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record) to prevent caching) shows that:\n\n  ![](assets/http-request-timings.webp)\n\n  - Resolving DNS and opening new TLS connection is slow (~160ms) but probably not notice how slow it is because the browser will open connect once and reuse it for many requests and HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 would be faster.\n\n  - Can't rely on reusing connections since the need of sending many requests to many different hosts in different networks.\n\n  - Would get rate-limited or banned quickly.\n\n- Solution: Spread the load on many servers\n\n  - Remove what we can from the steps: `Request parsing` and `DNS resolution`. (Simple crafted HTTP/1.1 requests by hand and [massdns](https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns) to resolve thousands of DNS records in a couple of seconds)\n\n  - Design the HTTP/1.1 sending mechanism:\n\n    - Multiple worker pools that piped together:\n\n      1. Request generation pool\n      2. Sender pool\n      3. Response pool\n\n    ![](assets/cannon-diagram.webp)\n\n    - Use a concurrency-safe [queue](https://github.com/enriquebris/goconcurrentqueue) to seperate the worker pools and to reuse the objects and memory as much as possible.\n\n  - Choose `fasthttp` over `net/http` to get x10 faster according to the [benmark](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp?tab=readme-ov-file#http-client-comparison-with-nethttp)\n\n  - Optimize the fasthttp's client to get rid of normalization step (fork and edit the lib)\n\n    ```go\n    req := rawfasthttp.AcquireRequest()\n    resp := rawfasthttp.AcquireResponse()\n\n    rawBytes := []byte(\"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: example.com\\r\\n\\r\\n\")\n\n    req.SetRequestRaw(rawBytes)\n\n    err := client.Do(req, resp)\n    ```\n\n  - Override the `Dial` function to use the resolved IP addresses:\n\n    ```go\n    // single instance of custom dialer\n    customDialer = \u0026rawfasthttp.TCPDialer{}\n\n    req := rawfasthttp.AcquireRequest()\n    resp := rawfasthttp.AcquireResponse()\n\n    resolved_ip := \"127.0.0.1\"\n\n    req.SetDial(func(addr string) (net.Conn, error) {\n        return customDialer.Dial(resolved_ip)\n    })\n\n    // ...\n    ```\n\n  - Optimize TLS handshake to prevent wasting CPU cycles by hardcoding the keys but had not enough time to change the fork so skipped.\n\n  - Split 2.5 million hosts into chunks with 200 hosts per chunk (not take more than a couple of minutes to complete but big enough to not waste time on creating new connections). (200 is optimal for the usecase, the worker pods were prone to fail =\u003e minimize the lost requests/ retries)\n\n  - Chose DigitalOcean with K8s to scale (cheapest one - 2TB+ of bandwidth per droplet). Also DigitalOcean gives new public IP for each droplet to avoid being banned from Cloudfare.\n\n  - Wrote a auto-scroller to scale the deployment up and down based on the targets in queue (0 to 60 pods in a couple of minutes)\n\n- Conclusion:\n\n  - The final results:\n\n    - Each pod achieved 100-400 requests per second\n    - Scaled to 60 pods\n    - Sent 500 million HTTP/1.1 requests to 2.5 million hosts in just a couple of hours\n\n  - Although there will be a next post for a further detailed result,\n\n## [How I build simple Mac apps using Go](https://dev.to/progrium/how-i-build-simple-mac-apps-using-go-104j)\n\n- Context:\n\n  - There were no bindinds to native Mac APIs for Go =\u003e [DarwinKit](https://github.com/progrium/darwinkit)\n\n    - Bindings for [33 frameworks](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/progrium/darwinkit/macos@main#section-directories) with near complete coverage:\n      - 2,353 classes\n      - 23,822 methods and properties\n      - 9,519 constants/enums\n      - 543 structs\n    - Automatic conversion and use of native Go builtin types in APIs\n    - Support for block arguments as Go functions with properly typed arguments\n    - Pre-made delegate implementations you can simply set Go functions on\n    - 1-to-1 mapping to Objective-C symbols while still idiomatic to Go\n    - Documentation for all symbols including a link to official Apple docs on that symbol\n    - Growing collection of high-quality example starter apps for sponsors\n\n- Future:\n\n  - There are no bindings to Apple framework functions.

One of the optimizations added in 1.22 is improved devirtualization, allowing static dispatch of more interface method calls. Most programs will see improvements between 2-14% with PGO enabled.\n\n    - Standard library additions\n\n      - A new **math/rand/v2** package provides a cleaner, more consistent API and uses higher-quality, faster pseudo-random generation algorithms. See the proposal for additional details.\n\n      - The patterns used by **net/http.ServeMux** now accept methods and wildcards.\n\n        For example, the router accepts a pattern like *GET /task/{id}/*, which matches only GET requests and captures the value of the {id} segment in a map that can be accessed through Request values.\n\n      - A new *Null[T]* type in **database/sql** provides a way to scan nullable columns.\n\n      - A Concat function was added in package **slices**, to concatenate multiple slices of any type.\n\n  - [Go 1.23 in August](https://go.dev/blog/go1.23)\n\n    - Range expressions in a *“for-range”* loop may now be iterator functions, such as ```func(func(K) bool)```. This supports user-defined iterators over arbitrary sequences. There are several additions to the standard slices and maps packages that work with iterators, as well as a new iter package. As an example, if you wish to collect the keys of a map m into a slice and then sort its values, you can do that in Go 1.23 with slices.Sorted(maps.Keys(m)).\n\n    - Preview support for generic type aliases.\n\n    - Tool improvements\n      \n      - Starting with Go 1.23, it’s possible for the Go toolchain to collect usage and breakage statistics to help understand how the Go toolchain is used, and how well it is working. This is *Go telemetry*, an opt-in system. Please consider opting in to help us keep Go working well and better understand Go usage. \n\n      - The go command has new conveniences. For example, running ```go env -changed``` makes it easier to see only those settings whose effective value differs from the default value, and ```go mod tidy -diff``` helps determine the necessary changes to the *go.mod* and *go.sum* files without modifying them. Read more on the Go command in the release notes.\n      \n      - The ```go vet``` subcommand now reports symbols that are too new for the intended Go version. \n\n- For next 15 years:\n\n  - Evolving Go to better leverage the capabilities of current and future hardware\n\n  - Go 1.24 will have a totally new map implementation under the hood that’s more efficient on modern CPUs. \n  \n  - Prototyping new garbage collection algorithms designed around the capabilities and constraints of modern hardware. \n\n  - Some improvements will be in the form of new APIs and tools so Go developers can better leverage modern hardware.\n\n  - Working on making Go better for AI—and AI better for Go (LangChainGo \u0026 Genkit)\n  \n\n\n---\n\nhttps://go.dev/blog/15years\n\nhttps://go.dev/blog/10years\n\nhttps://go.dev/blog/go1.22\n\nhttps://go.dev/blog/go1.23","title":"Go Commentary #20: Go Turns 15","short_title":"#20 Go Turns 15","description":"The 15th anniversary of the Go open source release","tags":["golang","go-weekly"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["fuatto"],"date":"Fri Nov 15 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/go/weekly/nov-15.md","slugArray":["playground","go","weekly","nov-15"]},{"content":"\n## [Go sync.Once is simple... Is it really?](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/go-sync-once/)\n\n### What is sync.Once?\n\n- \"Once is an object that will perform exactly one action\"\n\n```go\nvar once sync.Once\nvar conf Config\n\nfunc GetConfig() Config {\n    once.Do(func() {\n        conf = fetchConfig()\n    })\n    return conf\n}\n```\n\n- If `GetConfig()` is called multiple times, `fetchConfig()` is executed only once.\n\n```go\ntype Singleton struct {\n    // fields\n}\n\nvar (\n    instance *Singleton\n    once     sync.Once\n)\n\nfunc GetSingleton() *Singleton {\n    once.Do(func() {\n        instance = \u0026Singleton{}\n    })\n    return instance\n}\n```\n\n- The benefit: it delays certain operations until they are first needed (lazy-loading), which can improve runtime performance and reduce initial memory usage.\n\n```go\nvar once sync.Once\n\nfunc main() {\n    once.Do(func() {\n        fmt.Println(\"This will be printed once\")\n    })\n\n    once.Do(func() {\n        fmt.Println(\"This will not be printed\")\n    })\n}\n\n// Output:\n// This will be printed once\n```\n\n- No built-in way to reset a sync.Once, so if the function passed to Once.Do panics while running, the future calls to `Do(f)` won't run f again and will be tricky to catch the panic and handle the error afterward\n\n```go\nvar once sync.Once\nvar config Config\n\nfunc GetConfig() (Config, error) {\n    var err error\n    once.Do(func() {\n        config, err = fetchConfig()\n    })\n    return config, err\n}\n```\n\n- From Go 1.21, we get: `OnceFunc`, `OnceValue` and `OnceValues`\n\n```go\n// If f panics, the returned function will panic with the same value on every call. (cached)\nfunc OnceFunc(f func()) func() { \n  ...\n}\n\n// returns the value returned by f\nfunc OnceValue[T any](f func() T) func() T {\n  ...\n}\n\n// returns the values returned by f\nfunc OnceValues[T1, T2 any](f func() (T1, T2)) func() (T1, T2) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n- Example use:\n\n```go\nvar config Config\n\nvar getConfigOnce = sync.OnceValues(fetchConfig)\n\nfunc main() {\n  var err error\n\n  config, err = getConfigOnce()\n  if err != nil {\n    log.Fatalf(\"Failed to fetch config: %v\", err)\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n### How it works?\n\n- The implementation of Once\n\n```go\ntype Once struct {\n\tdone atomic.Uint32\n\tm    Mutex\n}\n```\n\n- Simply use mutex to lock and allows only 1 goroutine to enter; then if `done` is still 0 (function f hasn't run yet) set done to 1 and runs f()\n\n=\u003e Original version of sync.Once, written by Rob Pike in 2010\n```go\nfunc (o *Once) Do(f func()) {\n\to.m.Lock()\n\tdefer o.m.Unlock()\n\n\tif o.done.Load() == 0 {\n\t\to.done.Store(1)\n\t\tf()\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n- Not performant since it always locks first (goroutines wait on each other) whenever Do(f) is called.\n\n=\u003e check the flag done first before the lock\n\n```go\nfunc (o *Once) Do(f func()) {\n  if atomic.LoadUint32(\u0026o.done) == 1 {\n    return\n  }\n\n  // slow path\n  o.m.Lock()\n  defer o.m.Unlock()\n\n  if o.done.Load() == 0 {\n    o.done.Store(1)\n    f()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- This introduces the race condition\n\n![](assets/go-sync-once-done-mistake.webp)\n\n=\u003e add defer to when setting flag\n\n```go\nfunc (o *Once) Do(f func()) {\n  if o.done.Load() == 1 {\n    return\n  }\n\n  // slow path\n  o.m.Lock()\n  defer o.m.Unlock()\n\n  if o.done.Load() == 0 {\n    defer o.done.Store(1)\n    f()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Since Go compiler supports inlining (taking the function's code and paste it directly to where the function is called) optimization\n\n```go\nfunc (o *Once) Do(f func()) {\n\tif o.done.Load() == 0 {\n\t\to.doSlow(f)\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc (o *Once) doSlow(f func()) {\n\to.m.Lock()\n\tdefer o.m.Unlock()\n\n\tif o.done.Load() == 0 {\n\t\tdefer o.done.Store(1)\n\t\tf()\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nhttps://victoriametrics.com/blog/go-sync-once/\n\nhttps://go.dev/ref/mem","title":"Go Commentary #21: Go sync.Once is Simple","short_title":"#21 Go sync.Once is Simple","description":"Understanding Go's sync.Once - A Deep Dive into Single-Execution Guarantees and Atomic Operations","tags":["golang","go-weekly"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["fuatto"],"date":"Fri Nov 22 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/go/weekly/nov-22.md","slugArray":["playground","go","weekly","nov-22"]},{"content":"\n## [GoMLX: ML in Go without Python](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2024/gomlx-ml-in-go-without-python)\n\n### How ML models are implemented\n\n- Written in Python, using frameworks like TensorFlow, JAX or Pytorch that take care of:\n\n  - Expressive way to describe the model architecture, including auto-differentiation for training.\n  - Efficient implementation of computational primitives on common HW: CPUs, GPUs and TPUs.\n\n![](assets/openxla-diagram-with-gopher.png)\n\n- The frameworks that provide high-level primitives to define and translate ML models to a common interchange format called StableHLO (High-Level Operations).\n\n- The OpenXLA system, which includes two major components: the XLA compiler translating HLO to HW machine code, and PJRT - the runtime component responsible for managing HW devices, moving data (tensors) between the host CPU and these devices, executing tasks, sharding and so on.\n\n- HW that executes these models efficiently.

The trade-off, though, is that you might not get a perfectly consistent snapshot of the map while you’re iterating.\n\n\n- How it works:\n\n  - two separate native maps: the readonly map and the dirty map.\n\n  ```go\n    type Map struct {\n      mu Mutex\n      read atomic.Pointer[readOnly]\n      dirty map[any]*entry\n      misses int\n    }\n\n    type readOnly struct {\n      m       map[any]*entry\n      amended bool // true if the dirty map contains some key not in m.\n    }\n\n    type entry struct {\n      p atomic.Pointer[any]\n    }\n  ```\n\n  - readonly map is where the fast, lock-free lookups happen; built around an atomic.Pointer, which lets multiple goroutines access it without needing to lock anything. (ideal for scenarios where data is mostly being read and not frequently modified) \n  =\u003e the readonly map might not always hold the most up-to-date data, therefore dirty map\n\n  - dirty map stores any new entries that get added while the readonly map is still being used for lookups\n\n  ![syncmap_structure](assets/syncmap_structure.png)\n\n  =\u003e dirty map contains all the data from the readonly map, along with any new entries that haven’t yet been promoted to the readonly map\n\n  - when you update a value, all you need to do is update this pointer. Since both the readonly and dirty maps point to the same entry\n\n  ![double_pointer_indirection_syncmap](assets/double_pointer_indirection_syncmap.png)\n\n  - The behavior of the pointer in the entry struct defines the state of the entry in the map, and there are 3 possible states:\n\n    - **Normal state**: This is when the entry is valid. The pointer p is pointing to a real value, and the entry exists in those maps, meaning it’s actively in use and can be read without any issues.\n\n    - **Deleted state**: When an entry is deleted from a sync.Map, it’s not immediately removed from the readonly maps. Instead, the pointer p is simply set to nil, signaling that the entry has been deleted but still exists in the maps.\n\n    - **Expunged state**: This is a special state where the key is fully removed.

It fits better to capture such a benchmark in some remote branch for future reference though.\n\nConclusion:\n\n  - Should use both in a hybrid approach, depending on your goals. \n\n  - Can even use more features like `-format csv` to export to sheets and render charts\n\n## [Go Plan9 Memo, Speeding Up Calculations 450%](https://pehringer.info/go_plan9_memo.html)\n\nContext \n\n- want more power than Go's concurrency, encounter SIMD - Same Instruction Muliple Data, that many languages either have compiler optimizations use simd or libs that support it.\n\n- \"I just want a package that offers a thin abstraction layer over arithmetic and bitwise simd operations.\"\n\n- Go's assembler uses [Plan9](https://9p.io/plan9/)'s assemblers guidance which uses target platforms instructions and registers with slight modifications to their names and usage. This means that x86 Plan9 is different then say arm Plan9.\n\n  ```\n  example\n  ┣━ AddInts_amd64.s\n  ┗━ main.go\n  ```\n\n  ```\n  // +build amd64\n\n  TEXT ·AddInts(SB), 4, $0\n      MOVL    left+0(FP), AX\n      MOVL    right+8(FP), BX\n      ADDL    BX, AX\n      MOVL    AX, int+16(FP)\n      RET\n  ```\n\n  ```go\n  package main\n\n  import \"fmt\"\n\n  func AddInts(left, right) int\n\n  func main() {\n      fmt.Println(\"1 + 2 = \", AddInts(1, 2))\n  }\n  ```\n\n  **LINE 1**: The file contains amd64 specific instructions, so we need to include a Go build tag to make sure Go does not try to compile this file for non x86 machines.\n\n  **LINE 3**: You can think of this line as the functions declaration. TEXT declares that this is a function or text section. ·AddInts(SB) specifies our functions name. 4 represents “NOSPLIT” which we need for some reason. And $0 is the size of the function’s stack frame (used for local variables). It’s zero in this case because we can easily fit everything into the registers.\n\n  **LINE 4 \u0026 5**: Go’s calling convention is to put the function arguments onto the stack. So we MOVe both Long 32-bit values into the AX and BX registers by dereferencing the frame pointer (FP) with the appropriate offsets. The first argument is stored at offset 0. The second argument is stored at offset 8 (int’s only need 4 bytes but I think Go offsets all arguments by 8 to maintain memory alignment).\n\n  **LINE 6**: Add the Long 32-bit value in AX (left) with the Long 32-bit value in BX. And store the resulting Long 32-bit value in AX.\n\n  **LINE 7 \u0026 8**: Go’s calling convention (as far as I can tell) is to put the function return values after its arguments on the stack.

Welcome to the brave new world of Go, where Large Language Models reign supreme and every developer suddenly fancies themselves an AI expert. But before we dive headfirst into this cesspool of buzzwords and overengineered solutions, let's take a moment to examine what's really going on in our beloved gopher-land.\n\nThe LLM Gold Rush: Go's Ticket to Relevance? It seems the Go team has finally woken up to the fact that LLMs are the new darling of the tech world. Their recent blog post on \"Building LLM-powered applications in Go\" reads like a desperate attempt to stay relevant in a landscape dominated by Python frameworks. But here's the kicker - they might actually be onto something.\n\nGo's strengths in concurrency and networking make it a natural fit for the distributed nature of LLM applications. It's like watching a middle-aged dad suddenly discover he's got a knack for TikTok dances - unexpected, slightly uncomfortable, but oddly compelling.\n\nLet's look at their RAG server example:\n\n```Go\nfunc main() {\n\tctx := context.Background()\n\twvClient, err := initWeaviate(ctx)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tapiKey := os.Getenv(\"GEMINI_API_KEY\")\n\tgenaiClient, err := genai.NewClient(ctx, option.WithAPIKey(apiKey))\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer genaiClient.Close()\n\n\tserver := \u0026ragServer{\n\t\tctx:      ctx,\n\t\twvClient: wvClient,\n\t\tgenModel: genaiClient.GenerativeModel(generativeModelName),\n\t\tembModel: genaiClient.EmbeddingModel(embeddingModelName),\n\t}\n\n\tmux := http.NewServeMux()\n\tmux.HandleFunc(\"POST /add/\", server.addDocumentsHandler)\n\tmux.HandleFunc(\"POST /query/\", server.queryHandler)\n\n\tport := cmp.Or(os.Getenv(\"SERVERPORT\"), \"9020\")\n\taddress := \"localhost:\" + port\n\tlog.Println(\"listening on\", address)\n\tlog.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(address, mux))\n}\n```\n\n[full version at](https://github.com/golang/example/blob/master/ragserver/ragserver/main.go)\n\nSimple, clean, and to the point. No fancy decorators, no convoluted class hierarchies - just good old Go simplicity. It's almost refreshing in a world of over-abstracted Python monstrosities.\n\nBut here's where things get interesting. The Go team isn't content with just providing raw tools; they're pushing frameworks like LangChainGo and Genkit. It's as if they've looked at the Python ecosystem and thought, \"Hey, we can create incomprehensible abstractions too!\"\n\nLangChainGo: Because We Needed Another Layer of Abstraction LangChainGo promises to be the silver bullet for all your LLM needs. Want to switch vector databases without rewriting your entire codebase? LangChainGo's got you covered:\n\n```Go\ntype VectorStore interface {\n    AddDocuments(ctx context.Context, docs []schema.Document, options ...Option) ([]string, error)\n    SimilaritySearch(ctx context.Context, query string, numDocuments int, options ...Option) ([]schema.Document, error)\n}\n```\n\nIt's a beautiful interface, really. So clean, so abstract. But let's be real - how often are you actually switching vector databases? This is solution in search of a problem, the software equivalent of a Swiss Army knife when all you needed was a bottle opener.\n\nGenkit: Google's Answer to... Everything? Not to be outdone, Google throws its hat into the ring with Genkit. It's like LangChain, but with that special Google touch that screams, \"We'll deprecate this in two years, but trust us for now!\"\n\nGenkit promises \"production features\" and \"integrated developer tooling.\" Because apparently, what the world really needed was another way to manage prompts and deployments. It's as if Google looked at the mess of AI tooling and thought, \"You know what this needs? More complexity!\"\n\n### [The Ergo Framework: Erlang's Ghost Haunts Go](https://github.com/ergo-services/ergo)\n\nJust when you thought we couldn't possibly need another framework, along comes Ergo. It's bringing the actor model to Go, because apparently, we all miss the days of Erlang and its byzantine approach to concurrency.\n\nErgo boasts features like _Network Transparency_, _Observability_ and a _Supervisor Tree_. It's like they've taken every buzzword from distributed systems and thrown them into a blender. The result? A framework that promises to solve problems you didn't even know you had.\n\nHere's a taste of their \"Quick Start\":\n\n```bash\n$ ergo -init MyNode \\\n      -with-app MyApp \\\n      -with-sup MyApp:MySup \\\n      -with-actor MySup:MyActor \\\n      -with-web MyWeb \\\n      -with-actor MyActor2 \\\n      -with-observer\n```\n\nBecause nothing says \"simplicity\" like a command line that looks like it was designed by a committee of enterprise architects.\n\nThe Gopher's Dilemma So here we are, standing at the crossroads of Go's future. On one side, we have the simplicity and performance that made Go great. On the other, we have a smorgasbord of frameworks and abstractions promising to turn Go into a one-stop shop for all your LLM needs.\n\nThe question is, do we really need all this? Are we solving real problems, or are we just creating new ones in the name of \"progress\"?\n\nDon't get me wrong - it's exciting to see Go evolving and adapting to new challenges. But let's not lose sight of what made Go great in the first place. We don't need to become Python or Erlang. We need to be the best damn Go we can be.\n\nAs we forge ahead into this brave new world of LLMs and AI, let's remember the virtues of simplicity and pragmatism. By all means, let's embrace new technologies and paradigms. But let's do it the Go way - with clear, concise code that solves real problems, not imaginary ones.\n\nThe future of Go in the LLM era is bright, but it's up to us to ensure it doesn't become a tangled mess of frameworks and abstractions. Let's build tools that empower developers, not confuse them. After all, isn't that what Go was all about in the first place?\n\nRemember, in the world of software development, the only constant is change. But that doesn't mean we have to lose our way. Stay sharp, stay critical, and above all, stay Go.\n\n---\n\nhttps://go.dev/blog/survey2024-h2\n\nhttps://go.dev/blog/llmpowered\n\nhttps://github.com/ergo-services/ergo\n","title":"Go Commentary #11: The Gopher's LLM Revolution - Actors, Frameworks, and the Future of Go","short_title":"#11 Actors, Frameworks, and the Future of Go","description":"A critical look at Go's evolving role in the LLM ecosystem and the frameworks shaping its future","tags":["golang","go-weekly"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["fuatto"],"date":"Fri Sep 13 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/go/weekly/sep-13.md","slugArray":["playground","go","weekly","sep-13"]},{"content":"\n## [kl: An interactive Kubernetes log viewer for your terminal](https://github.com/robinovitch61/kl)\n\nAn interactive Kubernetes log viewer for your terminal.\n\n```\n// Example usage of kl\nkl --context my-context,other-context -n default,other-ns\n```\n\n![](assets/kl1.png)\n\n![](assets/kl2.png)\n\n![](assets/kl3.png)\n\n![](assets/kl4.png)\n\n- This tool allows you to view logs across multiple containers, pods, and even clusters. It's like kubectl logs on steroids, which begs the question: why isn't this functionality built into kubectl itself? The fragmentation of the Kubernetes ecosystem continues unabated, with each new tool solving a problem that arguably shouldn't exist in the first place.\n\n## [Restish](https://rest.sh/#/)\n\n- A \"CLI for interacting with REST-ish HTTP APIs.\" Because apparently, cURL and HTTPie weren't enough. Restish boasts features like automatic API discovery and generated commands:\n\n```\n# Perform an HTTP GET request\n$ restish api.rest.sh/types\n\n# Above is equivalent to:\n$ restish GET https://api.rest.sh/types\n```\n\n```https\nHTTP/2.0 200 OK\nContent-Length: 278\nContent-Type: application/cbor\nDate: Tue, 19 Apr 2022 21:17:58 GMT\n\n{\n  $schema: \"https://api.rest.sh/schemas/TypesModel.json\"\n  boolean: true\n  integer: 42\n  nullable: null\n  number: 123.45\n  object: {\n    binary: 0xdeadc0de\n    binary_long: 0x00010203040506070809...\n    date: 2022-04-23\n    date_time: 2022-04-23T21:41:58.20449651Z\n    url: \"https://rest.sh/\"\n  }\n  string: \"Hello, world!\"\n  tags: [\"example\", \"short\"]\n}\n```\n\nWhile it's undeniably clever, one has to wonder: are we solving real problems, or are we just creating more abstraction layers to satisfy our insatiable appetite for \"developer experience\"? The irony of using a CLI to interact with REST APIs – which were designed for machine-to-machine communication – is not lost on me.\n\n## [A fast full-text cli reader (works also with lobste.rs articles content)](https://github.com/piqoni/cast-text)\n\n- A \"zero latency, easy-to-use full-text news terminal reader.\" Yes, you read that correctly.

We've gone from command-line interfaces to graphical UIs, from desktop applications to web apps, and now we're seeing a resurgence of terminal-based tools. It's as if we're collectively suffering from option paralysis, overwhelmed by the complexity of modern software stacks and yearning for the perceived simplicity of text-based interfaces.\n\nBut here's the rub: these new CLI tools are often just as complex as their graphical counterparts. They're built on layers of abstractions, requiring knowledge of specific command syntaxes and flags. We haven't simplified; we've just shifted the complexity to a different domain.\n\n---\n\nhttps://github.com/robinovitch61/kl\n\nhttps://rest.sh/#/\n\nhttps://github.com/piqoni/cast-text\n","title":"Go Commentary #12: CLI Renaissance with Kubernetes, REST, and Terminal Readers in the Age of Complexity","short_title":"#12 CLI Tools for K8s, REST, and Terminals","description":"A critical examination of Go's resurgence in CLI tool development, exploring recent projects in Kubernetes log viewing, REST API interaction, and terminal-based readers, while questioning the industry's shift back to command-line interfaces.","tags":["golang","go-weekly","llm"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["fuatto"],"date":"Fri Sep 20 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/go/weekly/sep-20.md","slugArray":["playground","go","weekly","sep-20"]},{"content":"\n## [Register Allocation in the Go Compiler](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/09/24/go-compiler-register-allocation#go_s_register_allocator__a_high_level_view)\n\nRed Hat has graced us with a deep dive into Go's register allocation in the compiler. It's a fascinating peek under the hood, if you're into that sort of thing. But let's be real: how many of us are actually going to benefit from understanding the intricacies of register allocation? It's like knowing the exact chemical composition of the asphalt you're driving on – interesting, but ultimately irrelevant to most people's daily commute.\n\nThe Go team's obsession with compiler speed is admirable, I suppose. They've managed to create a register allocator that's \"very fast,\" taking up to 20% of the entire optimization pipeline's time. Bravo. But at what cost?\n\n```go\n// Imagine this is your codebase after Go's \"fast\" register allocation\nfunc someFunction() {\n    // Oops, your variable got spilled into a loop\n    for i := 0; i \u003c 1000000; i++ {\n        // Load from memory, use, store back to memory\n        // Repeat ad nauseam\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSure, your compile times are blazing fast. But your runtime? Well, that's a different story. The lack of a global view in the register allocator means you might end up with code that's about as efficient as a government bureaucracy.\n\nBut hey, at least it compiles quickly, right? Because that's what really matters in production – how fast you can push out potentially suboptimal code.\n\n## [BBQvec: An open-source, embedded vector index for Rust and Go](https://blog.daxe.ai/p/bbqvec-a-scalable-vector-search-library)\n\nSpeaking of optimizations, let's talk about the latest darling of the AI world: vector search. Daxe has thrown their hat into the ring with BBQvec, a \"scalable vector search library.\" Because clearly, what the world needs is another way to find the nearest neighbor in high-dimensional space.\n\nDon't get me wrong, vector search is useful. But the way the industry is salivating over it, you'd think it was the second coming of sliced bread. Every startup and their dog is now implementing some form of vector search, often without really understanding why or if they even need it.\n\n```go\n// The modern tech stack, apparently\ntype ModernAIStartup struct {\n    VectorSearch    *FancyVectorLib\n    LLM             *ChatGPT\n    ActualProduct   *WhoNeedsThis\n}\n```\n\nBBQvec claims to be all about scale, handling \"many billions of vectors.\" That's great, but let's pause for a moment. How many companies actually need to search through billions of vectors? And of those that do, how many are doing it for anything more than vanity metrics or to impress VCs?\n\nThe algorithm itself is clever, I'll give them that. Using random orthonormal basis sets and bitmaps for indexing is an interesting approach. But it's telling that their big selling point is how fast they can build the index, not necessarily how accurate or fast the actual searches are.\n\n---\n\nhttps://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/09/24/go-compiler-register-allocation#go_s_register_allocator__a_high_level_view\n\nhttps://blog.daxe.ai/p/bbqvec-a-scalable-vector-search-library\n","title":"Go Commentary #13: Compiler Quests and Vector Vexations","short_title":"#13 Compiler Quests and Vector Vexations","description":"A scathing look at Go's compiler internals and the vector search gold rush, exposing the industry's obsession with speed over substance","tags":["golang","go-weekly","llm"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["fuatto"],"date":"Fri Sep 27 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/go/weekly/sep-27.md","slugArray":["playground","go","weekly","sep-27"]}],"isListPage":true},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...slug]","query":{"slug":["playground","go"]},"buildId":"FWnnPWU1XftQ03ydxaEJf","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
