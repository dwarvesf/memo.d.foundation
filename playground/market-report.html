Available in 8B and 70B pretrained and instruction-tuned versions, Llama 3 is one of the current top open-source models, deployed across all major platforms, including cloud services.\n\n![](assets/market-report-april-2024_market-report-april-llm.webp)\n\n**Databricks** has stepped up with **[DBRX](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm)**, a model that outperforms older versions like LLaMA2-70B, and Grok-1 in areas such as language understanding, programming, math, and logic.\n\n**[Mixtral 8x22B](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-8x22b/)** is another notable entry, offering multilingual support with a 64K tokens context window, robust mathematics, programming skills, and native function-calling capabilities.\n\nWe see companies increasingly able to integrate or develop their AI solutions as these technologies become more affordable. Concerns like data privacy or training costs can be addressed, although data safety remains a concern. Lightweight models are cheaper to refine and moderate, and we expect a surge in the advancement of self-hosted solutions for software and infrastructure to meet these needs.\n\n## RAG advancement will focus on retrieval processes\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation **(RAG)** systems are revolutionizing the use of large language models by integrating real-time, accurate external data into their responses. This method significantly reduces the incidence of inaccurate generations (hallucinations) and is crucial in contexts requiring high reliability.\n\nWe believe that RAG remains the most trustworthy method for providing up-to-date and rich context to LLMs. As RAG solutions have been developed and widely used in production AI applications, we think the next advancements in this architecture to focus on scaling and optimizing user experience. The emphasis will likely be on refining retrieval processes to manage the growing expanse of online information, including multimodal data integration, enhancing RAG's applicability across various domains.\n\n![](assets/market-report-april-2024_market-report-april-rag.webp)\n\n_Taxonomy tree of RAG’s core techniques_\n\n## Demand for structured data with LLM models\n\nThe use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating structured outputs like JSON or SQL from natural language is becoming increasingly practical. These models are crucial for automating complex workflows and data pipelines, significantly enhancing productivity and reducing operational costs.\n\nThe well-defined method currently leading in reliably generating structured data is the architecture of Function Calling, pioneered by OpenAI. This approach is gradually being adopted by other AI models from Cohere, Mistral, and Google. For models not supporting this architecture, achieving reliable structured outputs is challenging due to the inherent variability in LLM responses. Therefore, we think there will be more advancements in outputting structured data, making it more accessible and reliable for various applications.\n\n## The shift to edge computing in modern web architectures\n\nEdge computing is enhancing performance by reducing latency between users and the data or compute resources they are accessing. Starting from the original static file caching in CDNs, it's now possible to run real-time operations in Edge Functions. Platforms like [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), [Fly.io](http://fly.io/), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) are at the forefront of simplifying edge computing for developers.\n\nRather than merely reacting to latency issues, solutions are increasingly being designed for the edge. For instance, authentication flows are often the first point to measure time-to-interactive metrics. Placing authentication services at the edge could be a primary step to consider.\n\nFurthermore, building Serverless applications typically reduces infrastructure maintenance costs by eliminating the need to set up and maintain servers. With mature infrastructure services, this shift not only improves user experience but also offers cost efficiency and increased reliability.\n\n### Migration to Bun\n\n[Bun 1.1](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.1) marks a significant upgrade in the JavaScript ecosystem, providing enhanced stability and compatibility with Node.js, especially on Windows platforms. Its performance benchmarks, such as package installation speeds surpassing those of Yarn and NPM, are compelling for developers seeking efficient development tools.\n\nWe anticipate more developers adopting Bun, initially as an alternative package management tool. Our tests in several projects show impressive speed improvements. However, one downside is that Bun's CLI is not as feature-rich as other tools like Yarn or PNPM, lacking functionalities such as interactive upgrade mode. Despite this, Bun is worth exploring for its potential benefits.\n\n![](assets/market-report-april-2024_market-report-april-bun.webp)\n\n_Time spent installing dependencies in a vite react app using `--ignore-scripts` on Windows._\n\n### The trend of copy-paste UI development\n\nWhen the copy-paste approach first emerged, led by [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), we didn't think it could become a mainstream UI development method. This approach eliminates the need for downloadable component libraries. Developers can now directly integrate required UI components into their projects, offering unprecedented flexibility and customization.\n\nWe still think popular UI libraries like MUI and AntD have strong positions as they provide a wide range of ready-to-use components that cover most cases when building web applications. However, the cost of providing too many options makes these libraries heavy to use both in learning and especially in app performance. We've experienced that projects bootstrap with MUI have significantly longer build times compared to other lightweight solutions such as UI components built with Shadcn.\n\n## References\n\n- https://llama.meta.com/llama3/\n- https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-8x22b/\n- https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm\n- [A Survey on Self-Evolution of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14387)\n- https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.1\n- [A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10981)\n- https://foundationcapital.com/ai-service-as-software\n- [How faithful are RAG models?

These tools aren't just speeding up workflows; they’re redefining what coding means. The shift towards using English prompts and reviewing AI-generated code diffs is changing the game—programming is becoming less about writing every line and more about guiding AI to do the heavy lifting.\n\nIt feels like we're revisiting the basics, but with a modern twist: developers are relearning their craft through collaboration with AI. This \"half-coding\" approach is where human intuition meets machine precision, curating code rather than writing it entirely. We expect that in the near future, coding without AI might become a relic, as developers lean on AI to handle more of the mechanical aspects of their work.\n\n![](assets/market-report-aug-2024-20240829141959101.webp)\n\n[https://x.com/karpathy/status/1827143768459637073](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1827143768459637073)\n\nLooking ahead, we see a future where software development revolves less around manual coding and more around directing AI to create optimal solutions. The challenge will be preserving the creativity and problem-solving that make development rewarding, while still embracing AI's efficiencies. For many of us, the idea of coding without AI is already hard to imagine, signaling a significant shift in software engineering.\n\n### Amazon developers embrace 79% of auto-generated code reviews for upgrading foundation software\n\nAmazon's GenAI assistant, Amazon Q, is revolutionizing software maintenance by slashing upgrade times from 50 developer-days to mere hours. We think this efficiency is a game-changer, allowing developers to focus on more valuable tasks instead of getting stuck on version upgrades. In less than six months, Amazon modernized over half its production Java systems with minimal developer involvement, proving the power of AI-driven automation.\n\nThe implications are profound—by migrating to newer Java versions quickly, Amazon has boosted security and saved an estimated $260 million annually. Perhaps most striking is that 79% of AI-generated code was shipped without further modification, highlighting the growing trust in AI systems to handle tasks once reserved for human developers.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, we expect even more profound changes in how software is developed, maintained, and upgraded. Developers are increasingly becoming overseers and guides as AI takes on more of the heavy lifting.\n\n![](assets/market-report-aug-2024-20240829142116844.webp)\n\n[https://x.com/ajassy/status/1826608791741493281](https://x.com/ajassy/status/1826608791741493281)\n\n## The next thing after generative UI is generative apps\n\nWe’re seeing the future unfold right before our eyes with generative UI, but the next big leap is already here: generative apps. Claude and ChatGPT are already capable of generating mini applications from a user prompt and allowing direct access to them. Imagine this: a super app where you describe out loud the app you need, and it’s built for you in moments. This could be incredibly useful for a lot of random one-off tasks, and we’re basically there.\n\nWe believe this development could fundamentally change how we interact with technology. A few powerful apps could rule them all. The convenience and flexibility of simply describing what you need and having an app materialize could revolutionize productivity, making this technology an essential part of daily lives.\n\n![](assets/market-report-aug-2024-20240829142212118.webp)\n\nThe user’s prompt to create a Bill Splitting App in Claude Mobile App\n\n## New features open more opportunities\n\n### **Prompt caching by Anthropic**\n\nAnthropic's prompt caching is a game-changer in optimizing AI application efficiency. By caching frequently used context, this feature dramatically reduces costs and latency—up to 90% and 85%, respectively. We see this as a significant boost for scenarios like conversational agents and coding assistants, where repeated context is crucial.\n\nEarly adopters are already reporting substantial improvements, showing the practical value of this feature. Notion's integration of prompt caching into its Claude-powered AI assistant, Notion AI, is a strategic move to optimize operations and enhance user experience.\n\nWith prompt caching now in public beta for various Claude versions, developers have the chance to experiment and find the best fit for their needs. We think this flexibility will drive broader adoption, positioning prompt caching as a central tool in the next wave of AI adoption.\n\n### Structured output by OpenAI\n\nOpenAI's introduction of structured outputs is a significant step forward in ensuring the precision of AI-generated data. By enabling outputs to adhere to developer-supplied JSON Schemas, this feature addresses the challenge of generating reliable JSON, particularly in fields where precision is paramount.\n\nWe expect this development to shift industry standards, with developers favoring structured outputs over traditional methods, especially for tasks requiring meticulous data formatting. The impact will be particularly profound in data-sensitive fields like finance and healthcare, where the accuracy of data is crucial.\n\n![](assets/market-report-aug-2024-20240829142256859.webp)\n\n[https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/supported-schemas](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/supported-schemas)\n\n### GPT-4o supports fine-tuning\n\nOpenAI’s fine-tuning for GPT-4o is a powerful step that we expect will enable developers to tailor AI models to their specific needs. With 1 million free training tokens per day through September 23, this offering presents a compelling opportunity for organizations to enhance AI performance without immediate costs.\n\nFine-tuning is especially valuable for applications where out-of-the-box models may not fully meet specific domain requirements. We see this as empowering developers to achieve superior results in tasks like natural language processing and specialized content generation.\n\nWhat makes this offering particularly appealing is the customization and control it provides. Developers retain full ownership of their business data, which is crucial in industries like finance and healthcare, where data privacy and security are top priorities.\n\n## Flux 1 and Deep Live Cam: New achievements in open media models\n\nBlack Forest Labs' Flux model marks a significant leap in open-source text-to-image AI. With 12 billion parameters, Flux is pushing the new achievement of image generation, especially in text and positioning. However, complex prompt adherence remains a challenge, reminding us that there's still room for improvement.\n\nMeanwhile, Deep Live Cam's real-time face-swapping capabilities signal the next frontier in AI-driven media manipulation. The ethical safeguards built into Deep Live Cam, designed to prevent inappropriate content processing, are just the start. We think the broader ethical concerns around deepfake technology will require ongoing dialogue and regulation.\n\nAs deepfake technology proliferates, it's reasonable to expect financial institutions like Visa and Mastercard to extend their oversight to platforms dealing with AI-generated media. This could usher in a new era of compliance, where online platforms are required to implement robust measures against deepfake misuse.\n\n![](assets/market-report-aug-2024-20240829142341673.webp)\n\n[https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam/blob/main/demo.gif](https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam/blob/main/demo.gif)\n\n## Shadcn, v0, Tailwind: The new standard for UI development\n\nWe are witnessing a significant shift in frontend development with a new workflow that blends cutting-edge tools and AI capabilities. Starting with a complex web app prototype using [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) and shadcn UI, the process integrates into a Next.js project with React, but the real magic happens in the refinement stage. Tools like Cursor and Claude 3.5 Sonnet interpret and implement intricate design instructions, creating highly desirable web screens.\n\nWe think this approach will push the prototyping process further and faster, even designers can skip traditional design tools and jump directly into working on a live-action version of the mockup. Furthermore, we expect shadcn and Tailwind to gain traction, becoming essential components of the new toolkit in UI development.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://x.com/karpathy/status/1827143768459637073](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1827143768459637073)\n- [https://x.com/ajassy/status/1826608791741493281](https://x.com/ajassy/status/1826608791741493281)\n- [https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/)\n- [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41088013](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41088013)\n- [https://deeplive.cam/](https://deeplive.cam/)\n- [https://www.anthropic.com/news/prompt-caching](https://www.anthropic.com/news/prompt-caching)\n- [https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-fine-tuning/](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-fine-tuning/)\n- [https://blackforestlabs.ai/#get-flux](https://blackforestlabs.ai/#get-flux)","title":"Market report August 2024","short_title":"August 2024","description":"Explore the August 2024 market report to discover how AI and LLM tools like Cursor, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Amazon Q are transforming software development.

This change emphasizes the importance of optimizing cloud expenditures, forecasting cloud spend, and assessing the impact of AI/ML costs. Additionally, an increase in collaboration between FinOps and sustainability teams is anticipated, highlighting a comprehensive approach to financial and environmental stewardship in cloud computing.\n\n## Cybersecurity: A call for memory safety\n\nThe White House Office of the National Cyber Director's report on cybersecurity underscores the critical [need for memory-safe programming languages](https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2024/02/26/press-release-technical-report). By advocating for the adoption of languages like C#, Go, Java, Python, Rust, and Swift, the report highlights the importance of mitigating vulnerabilities inherent in non-memory-safe languages like C and C++.\n\n## References\n\n- [Whitehouse press release technical report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2024/02/26/press-release-technical-report)\n- [Key priorities shift in 2024](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/)\n- [MobileLLM: Optimizing sub-billion parameter language models for on-device use cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14905?utm_source=tldrai)\n- [The era of 1-bit LLMs: All large language models are in 1.58 bits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764?utm_source=tldrai)\n- [Automated unit test improvement using large language models at Meta](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09171)\n- [Testgen LLM AI writes testing case Meta](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/testgen-llm-ai-writes-testing-cases-meta-adam-faik-mzuae/)\n- [Rethinking serverless with flame](https://fly.io/blog/rethinking-serverless-with-flame/)\n- [AWSLabs](https://github.com/awslabs/llrt)\n- [Nvidia CEO: Don't learn to code](https://fusionmarketer.com/industry-news/dont-learn-to-code-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang/)\n- [Sora](https://openai.com/sora)\n","title":"Market report February 2024","short_title":"February 2024","description":"This month has been a continuation of AI and an upwards trend on FinOps and CyberSecurity. On top of those domains, there has been smaller, but very notable trends on the growth of Software as a Service (SaaS) or MicroSaaS' have rebound and created significant growth for serverless services, as a means to avoid startup and initial running costs. Likewise, AI has been changing how we work and how we design systems to enrich workflows and create more naturally interactive apps.","tags":["labs","market-report","AI","LLM","cybersecurity","serverless"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["monotykamary","thanh"],"date":"Fri Mar 01 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/market-report/2024-february.md","slugArray":["playground","market-report","2024-february"]},{"content":"\n## Trends on our radar\n\nHere are some of the few trends we are seeing across the industry, in our projects, as well as our community. This market report isn't exhaustive, at least just yet, with certain trends not yet listed such as Design, DevEx, etc. We see a lot of promising trends and we hope that understanding what engineers and firms are becoming more passionate about that it will help us create a foundation of ideas and knowledge.\n\n### Stagnation of React and the need to simplify the frontend\n\nReact has been the powerhouse to many small, medium, and large enterprise systems. It's declarative model along with the backing of Facebook plus its expansive ecosystem makes it the default go-to library for frontend systems. However, There has no major update in the recent two years, with a lot of the core members moving towards Vercel and Next.js. Next.js and Vercel have become extremely prevalent in every startup stack which has raised concerns of **vendor lock-in**, not to mention **increase in prices** for their services. In addition, there has been greater demand to move towards Multi-Page Applications (MPAs), vs what React commonly aims for: Single-Page Applications (SPAs), which creates a competition space against React.\n\nTo add upon, there have been more interest towards HTMX, both in our community, team, and the industry. HTMX is a library that simplifies HTTP request handling by making common functionality available via HTML attributes. Since it complements HTML, it can fit into almost every type of frontend application that interacts with the Web. It's been trending as the ideal way to minimize JavaScript usage across apps.\n\n### A rising ecosystem of Rust applications\n\nRust’s ecosystem is constantly improving and expanding. Many big projects use Rust and experience the success that the power of the language brings. Some examples of projects using Rust are Zed, a code editor, and Mastro, a UNIX-like OS. Moreover, in the most accessible environment - the web, Rust is becoming a mainstream choice for front-end infrastructure and compiler engines. Just recently, Servo, a new Rust-based browser engine, was released. We can expect Rust to have more applications playing the role for rendering UI, as it enables compilation into higher-quality WebAssembly code, with its presence will gradually appear in browsers. The idea to \"Rewrite It In Rust\" (RIIR), once a meme, is now unironically becoming the approach to act as the most rounded programming language in the industry.\n\n### Rise of in-house, AI-assisted productivity tools\n\nThe rise in in-house productivity tools is driven by the need for businesses to adapt to remote work, improve efficiency, facilitate collaboration, and enhance employee motivation and satisfaction. Although there are a myriad of tools, **there is not a single tool that rules them all** and fits the needs of specific use-cases for certain firms. There is a common trend to **move away from data silos and fragmented tooling to more highly integrated software**.\n\nLikewise, tightly coupled integration of data enrichment for AI virtual assistants has allowed them to become generally available as consumer products. Although not a new trend, AI with knowledge enrichment has been a growing effort across all industries. Complex task AI apps like [Taskade](https://www.taskade.com/) as well as complementary apps like [Murf](https://murf.ai/) and [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) have changed the landscape for what a productivity tool can provide.\n\n### The big step towards LLMs away from OpenAI\n\n`mistral-medium`, one of Mistral's strongest (and currently not open-sourced LLMs) have been in closed-preview to a select few API subscribers. It has been touted as being able to compete with GPT4, which creates a path to democratizing LLMs strong enough to move away from OpenAI. Lately, there have been news that they accidentally leaked [`miqu-1-70b`](https://anakin.ai/blog/miqu-1-70b/). There are mixed reviews as to whether it beats GPT4, but it is still pretty close along with many of the state-of-the-art LLMs on comparative benchmarks. The space for LLM engineering has been growing at a break-neck pace, closing the gap of large companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google within the past year.\n\n### Trading bots\n\n**Trading bots** are automated software programs designed to execute buy and sell orders in financial markets, including **currencies**, **stocks**, **crypto**, and other assets. These bots operate autonomously, allowing traders to engage in passive trading 24/7. Precision trading bots such as 1000pip Climber System, Waka Forex, and for crypto - L2T Algo, are some of the few popular ones leading up to 2024.\n\nAcross both the crypto world and in the finance industry, there has been growing consumer and business demand for trading bots and price watchers. The problem space isn't new, but there are many areas for optimization which traders want to take advantage of. Likewise, there is a demand for copy trading for US stocks on winning traders, people in congress, and notable figures.\n\n### A need for updating cybersecurity\n\nWith an increase in cybercrime with the [‘Mother of all breaches’](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/mother-of-all-breaches-data-leak-reveals-26-billion-account-records-stolen-from-twitter-linkedin-more/ar-BB1h8uz2) and the Congress hearing on [child safety on social networks](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/tiktok-snap-x-and-meta-ceos-grilled-at-tense-senate-hearing-on-social-media-and-kids/ar-BB1hxlbh), the demand for cybersecurity is higher than ever. Ransomware attacks continue to plague organizations worldwide, with these malicious incidents demanding better response strategies and proactive measures to prevent them. In addition, cybercriminals are increasingly using AI to craft sophisticated social engineering attacks.\n\nIn the industry, there is a growing **skill gap** for cybersecurity engineers, creating demand on initiatives for upskilling and reskilling know-how on cybersecurity. The concept of [Zero Trust](https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/industry-news/2023/track-these-7-trends-for-proactive-cybersecurity-in-2024)—where no one is automatically trusted, even within the organization—has gained much higher prominence leading up towards 2024.\n\n## References\n\n- [穿越时空：2023 年前端技术盘点与 2024 年技术展望](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/LiygBJqMN8U_vSpAjxMibQ)\n- [Increased investment in productivity and collaboration tools](https://discord.com/channels/462663954813157376/788084358991970337/1200049567765368882)\n- [‘Mother of all breaches’ data leak reveals 26 billion account records stolen from Twitter, LinkedIn, more (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/mother-of-all-breaches-data-leak-reveals-26-billion-account-records-stolen-from-twitter-linkedin-more/ar-BB1h8uz2)\n- [The Growing Cybersecurity Skills Gap: Recognizing the Need for Action](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/growing-cybersecurity-skills-gap-recognizing-need-action-khatri)\n- [A New Era of Galaxy AI is Coming — Here’s a Glimpse – Samsung Global Newsroom](https://news.samsung.com/global/a-new-era-of-galaxy-ai-is-coming-heres-a-glimpse)\n- [Freethink on X: \"#CES2024: AI startup Rabbit’s R1 device sells out in 24 hours https://t.co/Wzr2lzuh68 @rabbit_hmi https://t.co/4l3omjGjfX\" / X (twitter.com)](https://twitter.com/freethinkmedia/status/1745560844824396135)\n- [NPUs are essential for AI, but what are they, and how do they differ from GPUs? | Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/what-is-npu-vs-gpu)\n- [Django, HTMX and Alpine.JS: A Match Made In Heaven - DEV Community](https://dev.to/nicholas_moen/what-i-learned-while-using-django-with-htmx-and-alpine-js-24jg)\n- [React, where are you going?](https://dev.to/matfrana/react-where-are-you-going-5284)\n- [Annoyed at React](https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/annoyed-at-react/)\n- [Trending Frontend Technologies](https://virtuslab.com/blog/trending-frontend-technologies/)\n- [Zed Repository](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed)\n- [Servo Repository](https://github.com/servo/servo)\n- [Mistral CEO confirms ‘leak’ of new open source AI model nearing GPT-4 performance](https://venturebeat.com/ai/mistral-ceo-confirms-leak-of-new-open-source-ai-model-nearing-gpt-4-performance)\n- [Taskade](https://www.taskade.com/)\n- [13 Best Trading Robots for February 2024 Reviewed (techopedia.com)](https://www.techopedia.com/investing/best-trading-robots)\n- [Track These 7 Trends for Proactive Cybersecurity in 2024](https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/industry-news/2023/track-these-7-trends-for-proactive-cybersecurity-in-2024)\n","title":"Market report January 2024","short_title":"January 2024","description":"Here are some of the few trends we are seeing across the industry, in our projects, as well as our community.

Compared to previous versions, GPT-4o has made significant improvements in natural language processing, conversation fluency, and emotional expression. Whether it's for everyday conversations or professional inquiries, ChatGPT-4o provides accurate and in-depth answers. This advancement could disrupt existing business models and technologies, particularly in conversational AI, Ed-tech, and call centers, which may struggle to keep up with the rapid progress of AI.\n\nWe have already seen individuals use the capabilities of multimodal reasoning and generation to handle complex tasks, such as watching hours of video, writing reports, and sending them to relevant parties. With a large context window of up to 128,000 tokens and faster, cheaper APIs, the efficiency and scope of these models have dramatically increased.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) like those from OpenAI are becoming foundational for a new wave of software. The release of GPT-4o suggests that these models should be considered akin to operating systems (OS), upon which many rich applications can be built.\n\nMoreover, we think there will be a growing trend of connecting LLM platforms with various data sources and types. For instance, integrating a chat interface with data services to extract insights from reports. This process involves reading diverse data sources and translating them into useful insights. Additionally, there is an increasing demand for optimizing frontend user experiences, such as rendering charts or 3D models based on processed data.\n\n![](assets/market-report-may-2024_may-2024-market-report-gpt4o.webp)\n\n_Integrate GPT-4o chatbot with Google Sheets to generate insights from reports._\n\n## Job market trends: Demand for advanced and veteran programmers\n\nThe demand for advanced and veteran programmers is rising as companies seek to address the increasing complexity of modern software development and the need for efficient problem-solving skills. Many organizations now prefer candidates with extensive experience over newcomers. This trend is partly driven by the limitations observed in some programmers' skills, leading companies to favor seasoned professionals who can navigate complex challenges and contribute significantly from day one, now with the demand for hardware engineering growing.\n\nThe barrier to entry for programming has never been lower than before with AI, but now with emerging barriers for more bespoke and advanced software. We expect this trend to continue, as there has been great emphasis and importance on continuous learning and skill enhancement in the tech industry.\n\n## The rise of prescriptive AI\n\nPrescriptive AI is becoming a significant trend, offering solutions that go beyond predictive analytics by recommending actions based on data insights. This form of AI can transform industries by optimizing decision-making processes and operational efficiency to enable resilient supply chains or better manage public finances. One example, in manufacturing, prescriptive AI analysis can process vast amounts of vision data to suggest improvements, reduce downtime, and recommend/alert on urgent fixes. Its ability to provide actionable recommendations makes it a powerful tool for businesses aiming to leverage data for strategic advantage.\n\nWith agentic designs for AI being more mainstream, we think that the integration of prescriptive AI will soon become a standard practice across various sectors, driving innovation with actionable AI assistants in both the software and hardware space.\n\n## Web development shift: Is your code outdated?\n\nThe web development landscape is undergoing a transformative shift. React 19 has introduced a major change, reflecting the evolving nature of JavaScript frameworks and the ongoing debates in the developer community. A significant trend is the move towards keeping HTML templates on the server while maintaining front-end interactivity similar to technologies like Hotwire and LiveView. React, traditionally focused on component-based development, is now venturing into this space, offering solutions for managing the network gap.\n\nThe seamless integration between the frontend and backend in React eliminates the need for developers to worry about data passing between them. Although it may seem unconventional for a frontend library to handle network and backend tasks, the \"[Mind The Gap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhE-CepH2g)\" demo showcased React components rendered on the server and then teleported to the browser. This blurring of the network gap between frontend and backend frameworks, while maintaining high interactivity on the client side, is an approach worth exploring. Developers should stay curious about these new methodologies as they could potentially make traditional frontend-backend API connections obsolete.\n\n![](assets/market-report-may-2024_may-2024-market-report-react-19.webp)\n\n_React code can now interact with the network and a small part of the backend._\n\n## GraphQL: Not our choice\n\nGraphQL is a technology we have never fully committed to. While we have experimented with it and inherited projects that use it, we prefer the simplicity of having all API endpoint code in one file rather than navigating the complexities of GraphQL’s various layers and models. JSON REST APIs remain our preferred choice.\n\nA recent [debate](https://bessey.dev/blog/2024/05/24/why-im-over-graphql/) highlighted dissatisfaction with GraphQL. Like many trendy technologies, GraphQL works well for small projects but becomes problematic as project requirements grow more complex. Increased adoption and demand on the API lead to more debugging time. GraphQL exacerbates these challenges, with vague issue descriptions, harder-to-find log entries, and performance issues appearing randomly. For us, the \"boring\" REST API remains the preferred choice.\n\n## Bend: A parallel programming language for the AI age?\n\nThis month introduced [Bend](https://higherorderco.com/), a new programming language designed to scale performance by default on massively parallel hardware like GPUs. Parallel computing accelerates problem-solving by using multiple computers or cores, but it can be challenging due to synchronization issues. Bend simplifies this by making parallelism the default, requiring no specialized knowledge of CUDA or other parallel technologies.\n\nBend replaces traditional loops with the concept of “fold,” allowing recursive data types to be consumed in parallel. The performance gains are significant, with code execution times dropping from 30 seconds on a CPU to just 1.5 seconds on a GPU using Bend. Despite its high-level features akin to Python and Haskell, Bend supports fast object allocations, higher-order functions with closures, unrestricted recursion, and continuations, making it an exciting prospect for data processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n![](assets/market-report-may-2024_may-2024-market-report-ben-lang.webp)\n\n## References\n\n- [https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/)\n- [https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o)\n- [https://openai.com/index/improvements-to-data-analysis-in-chatgpt/](https://openai.com/index/improvements-to-data-analysis-in-chatgpt/)\n- [https://openai.com/index/be-my-eyes/](https://openai.com/index/be-my-eyes/)\n- [https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Bend](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Bend)\n- [https://bessey.dev/blog/2024/05/24/why-im-over-graphql/](https://bessey.dev/blog/2024/05/24/why-im-over-graphql/)\n- [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40521518](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40521518)\n- [Mind The Gap\" by Ryan Florence](https://www.notion.so/Market-Report-May-2024-9ad25dcb3fbb4a0ebb9744a44733913c?pvs=21)\n- [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40224213](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40224213)\n- [https://x.com/aznweng/status/1780594562597081362](https://x.com/aznweng/status/1780594562597081362)\n- [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-driven-manufacturing-exploring-intersection-ai-analytics-goyal-exqcc/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-driven-manufacturing-exploring-intersection-ai-analytics-goyal-exqcc/)\n- [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00207543.2024.2341415](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00207543.2024.2341415)\n- https://one.oecd.org/document/GOV/SBO(2024)14/en/pdf\n","title":"Market report may 2024","short_title":"May 2024","description":"In May's market report, we explore GPT-4o's advancements, the rising demand for veteran programmers, the transformative power of prescriptive AI, React 19's impact on network gaps, the growing complexity of GraphQL codebases, and Bend, a new parallel programming language.","tags":["labs","market-report","AI","LLM"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh","monotykamary"],"date":"Wed Jun 19 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/market-report/2024-may.md","slugArray":["playground","market-report","2024-may"]},{"content":"\n## Key takeaways\n\n- **AI chat evolves**: Chat interfaces advance, potentially leading to a unified tool for diverse tasks, such as browser and OS integration.\n\n- **Tech infrastructure investment**: The rising AI demand drives infrastructure needs, boosting AI applications more accessible and integral to daily functions.\n\n- **Python takes lead**: Python surpasses JavaScript due to rising in AI adoption.\n\n- **Coding assistance anti-patterns**: Relying too heavily on generated code risks messy projects, underscoring the need for solid engineering practices.\n\n- **Why techies leave Big Tech**: Talent exits Big Tech due to stagnant roles, layoffs, and fewer growth opportunities, shifting interest toward startups.\n\n- **Who is hiring?**: Skilled tech roles focus on Python, TypeScript, and Rust, with a need for expertise in WebAssembly, Nix, and system-level knowledge.\n\n## AI chat evolves: One interface to rule them all\n\nOctober brought a wave of new developments in AI, showing just how far chat interfaces have come. **Anthropic** introduced a demo called [Computer Use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use) where models can use software in a way that mirrors human interaction with computer. This breakthrough opens up new ways to streamline tasks and make work more efficient.\n\n**OpenAI also rolled out [Canvas](https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/)**, which takes ChatGPT from being a simple chat tool to a collaborative partner in writing and coding. Canvas gives users a shared space to work together, creating a more interactive experience. Meanwhile, **ChatGPT got an upgrade in its [web search](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/) abilities**, delivering quicker, more accurate answers supported by solid sources. The plan is to continue improving this feature to cover areas like shopping and travel, making it even more practical for everyday use.\n\nWe’re observing a single chat interface that can manage various types of tasks, paving the way for the imminent release of a focused tool like LLM browser or even OS.\n\n## The unseen investment in tech infrastructure\n\nAI products are used ubiquitously, with usage expected to only increase moving forward. This also raises the demand for building data centers, computers, and energy supplies. Not only that, techniques to optimize the use of the resources are becoming increasingly demanded. We observe that as hardware matures, it could potentially enable many use cases for software development. Some of our views are as follows:\n\n- While some predict a bubble similar to the internet, we see key differences: more computing power makes AI increasingly smarter and more capable.\n- Demand for AI is driving infrastructure needs, which is lowering overall costs.\n- As infrastructure and techniques improve, AI applications will become more refined and embedded in daily life, much like the internet’s evolution.\n- Smarter AI will expand applications significantly—think of LLMs integrated into operating systems.\n\n![](assets/2024-october-20241104223344499.webp)\n\n## Python becomes the no. 1 programming language\n\n[**GitHub's October 2024 report**](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/) came with big news: Python has overtaken JavaScript as the most popular language. This shift is thanks to a big jump in the adoption of modern tech and a wave of developers moving from JavaScript to TypeScript.\n\nSome key trends from the report:\n\n- **Smaller scale models**, such as Meta’s LLaMA, are becoming widely adopted. Academic research has become the pivotal domain attracting significant development effort.\n- AI models are becoming **standard toolkits** for developers. Soon, AI will not just be a code generator, but a general problem-solving tool.\n- The growth of **Rust** attests to the industry’s increasing emphasis on safety becoming a focal point in software development.\n- **Africa and Latin America** are emerging as significant hubs for outsourcing and tech entrepreneur.\n\n![](assets/2024-october-20241104223429609.webp)\n\n## Coding assistance anti-patterns\n\nEven as new tools become available, some issues have surfaced in how they’re used. Generated code now makes up a big part of work at software companies, but it’s not without problems:\n\n- Leaning too heavily on automated suggestions can lead to messy code.\n- The idea that tools can replace a second pair of eyes in coding doesn’t hold up.\n- Generated code tends to go for brute force rather than well-thought-out solutions, which can bloat projects.\n\nThe bottom line is, **teams should double down on solid engineering practices**, including unit testing and other proven quality checks. This helps ensure that these tools boost productivity without adding hidden complexities.\n\n## Why techies are leaving Big Tech\n\nThere is a [discussion](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/leaving-big-tech) around why talent leaving Big Tech, and the reasons go beyond what you might expect. Many professionals spoke about feeling stuck—doing more administrative work and less actual building. The lack of challenging projects has left them frustrated and uninspired.\n\nThe generous paychecks at these firms have given many the cushion they need to take bigger career risks, such as joining startups or starting their own ventures. But there’s more to it now: job security isn’t what it used to be. Mass layoffs, once a rarity, are making folks rethink whether Big Tech is as safe as it once seemed. This has led to a job market that splits experienced pros, who remain in high demand, from juniors, who find fewer opportunities. Companies may need to consider investing in mentorship and training to keep fresh talent flowing.\n\n## Who is hiring?\n\n[The job market in October](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ZCs7CYyHJBMFfNqcIGleuWpGi5RfXnoGD-Rgz-BGt0/) showed both promise and challenges. There’s still a strong demand for skilled workers, but the focus has shifted to those with specific expertise. **Remote roles** are widely available.\n\nWhen it comes to tech stacks, **Python, TypeScript, and Rust** are highly sought after. These languages have proven their value in building modern, efficient systems. On top of that, there’s a call for specialized skills like **WebAssembly**, **Nix** and system-level knowledge, hinting at a shift toward performance-focused work.\n\nLooking at job descriptions, common areas of expertise include **platform building**, **data management**, **systems work**, and **security**. Companies are searching for well-rounded developers who can tackle complex projects and create solid solutions.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/)\n- [https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/leaving-big-tech](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/leaving-big-tech)\n- [Thoughworks Tech Radar Vol 31](https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/radar/2024/10/tr_technology_radar_vol_31_en.pdf)\n- [https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/technology-strategy/macro-trends-tech-industry-october-2024](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/technology-strategy/macro-trends-tech-industry-october-2024)\n- [https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas](https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/)\n- [https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/)\n- [https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use)\n- [https://www.apricitas.io/p/the-ai-investment-boom](https://www.apricitas.io/p/the-ai-investment-boom)\n- [Alphabet 2024 Q3 earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjkf4t8BfLM)\n","title":"Market report October 2024","short_title":"October 2024","description":"Explore the October 2024 market report: chatbots as productivity essentials with future potential, AI's role despite investment bubble concerns, and Python's rise in modern tech and AI.

While many see these models as the next evolution of AI, it’s important to note that they introduce trade-offs between cost and performance. The key question is whether these reasoning models are truly effective or whether they’ll end up consuming more tokens without delivering significant benefits.\n\nThe models seem to build on the \"chain of thought\" prompting pattern (which literally can be employed with any model), but early adopters are still debating if they’re worth the hype. While reasoning tokens are hidden from the user, they still take up space in the model’s context window and incur costs.\n\n\u003e \"People are excited about tokens being 100x cheaper, but now we have models using 100x more tokens.\"\n\n### Contextual retrieval: A new embedding technique for RAG system\n\nAnthropic's introduction of [contextual retrieval](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval) marks a new advancement in how AI models access and utilize background knowledge. Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions often strip away context when encoding information, leading to failures in retrieving relevant data.\n\nWe see contextual retrieval addressing this gap by:\n\n- Prepending chunk-specific explanatory context to each data chunk before embedding.\n- Increasing the likelihood of including relevant information by adding more chunks into the context window.\n\nThis technique isn't just limited to Anthropic's products but can be a general solution to enhance any RAG system's performance. We expect this to improve the efficiency of AI models in specific contexts, making them more reliable and effective in tasks that require extensive background knowledge.\n\n![](assets/market-report-sept-2024-20241008180331830.webp)\n\n## Generative AI in legacy codebases\n\nOne of the most powerful capabilities of generative AI is its ability to summarize large volumes of text and media. In software delivery, this translates to helping developers and business analysts understand complex or legacy codebases more efficiently.\n\nWe are seeing tools like [GitHub Copilot Workspace](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace), and [Amazon Q's developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) agent revolutionize how we interact with code:\n\n- **Visual abstractions:** These tools provide visual representations of code, revealing intentions while minimizing technical jargon.\n- **Knowledge preservation:** They mitigate risks associated with the loss of expertise when key developers leave.\n- **Tech stack migrations:** They simplify the process of migrating to new technologies by providing clearer overviews of existing systems.\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain:\n\n- **Abstract comprehension:** Fully understanding code through abstract concepts is still a hurdle.\n- **Generic problem solving:** Current AI agents are not yet the universal problem solvers they aspire to be.\n\nWe think it's crucial to focus on specific problem spaces where these agents excel, rather than expecting them to handle every coding challenge. Their true value lies in augmenting developer capabilities in targeted areas.\n\n## The rise of small models\n\nWhile most users rely on commercial giants like ChatGPT, researchers and developers are finding value in running smaller models locally. Tools like [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) are proving that AIs with 8 to 70 billion parameters can run efficiently on personal devices, including laptops. As hardware continues to improve, local models will become an increasingly viable alternative for tasks that don’t require massive computational power.\n\nThe immutability of local models also guarantees consistency, making them indispensable in scientific research, where reproducibility is key. With the recent release of [**Llama 3.2**](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/) supporting vision, we’re seeing even more possibilities for lightweight, portable AI.\n\n## Serverless overuse is becoming a problem\n\nServerless computing may have once seemed like a silver bullet, but it's now becoming clear that it's not the answer to every problem. We’re seeing a growing number of cases where serverless is being misapplied, particularly in scenarios that require a persistent server.\n\nIt’s fine to start with serverless when you're small, but as usage scales, moving to a dedicated server can save a lot of time and money. It’s time for developers to get smarter about where and when to use serverless architectures.\n\n![](assets/market-report-sept-2024-20241008180500405.webp)\n\n## OpenAI ditches Next.js for Remix\n\nThis month, OpenAI surprised the community by switching the framework behind ChatGPT from **Next.js to Remix**. While the exact reasons haven’t been disclosed, there are a few theories. Remix’s ability to handle server-side rendering more efficiently and reduce the need for API calls seems to have played a part.\n\nMeanwhile, Next.js has grown increasingly complex, with new features like server actions and app routing that have pushed its build times longer. This complexity may have driven developers to look for leaner alternatives like Remix, particularly for client-heavy applications.\n\n![](assets/market-report-sept-2024-20241008180546529.webp)\n\n## JavaScript in crisis?\n\nWe’ve been following the thought-provoking observations from [Mathias Schäfer](https://molily.de/something-went-wrong/) regarding the current state of JavaScript in web development, and many of his points resonate with us:\n\n- No matter which framework you choose, it will likely be outdated within five years.\n- The relentless focus on improving the developer experience is a driving force in the industry.\n- The solution lies in web architectures that minimize client-side JavaScript dependency.\n- React's performance is often compromised by multiple architectural layers, exacerbating the issue.\n- Frameworks should disappear from client-side code, thanks to compilers, leaving only minimal runtime on the client.\n- Your JavaScript should work across different runtimes and frameworks—vendor lock-in should be avoided.\n- Frameworks should share core APIs and primitives. The Vue community has done excellent work in this regard, with tools like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/), [Vinxi](https://github.com/nksaraf/vinxi), and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) proving useful across many stacks.\n\nWe believe those takeaways should be taken into consideration by any builder who wants to build for the next web.\n\n## Who is hiring?\n\nOur analysis of the latest [job posts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41425910) in Y Combinator’s hiring thread shows that while the number of job listings has remained steady, it's only a third of what it was in 2022.
