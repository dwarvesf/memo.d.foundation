Three Practices\n- First, take a small upcoming change to the system – a User Story – and talk about concrete examples of the new functionality to explore, discover and agree on the details of what’s expected to be done.\n- Next, document those examples in a way that can be automated, and check for agreement.\n- Finally, implement the behaviour described by each documented example, starting with an automated test to guide the development of the code.\nThe aim is to: \n- make small changes rapidly\n- back up 1 level when need more info\n- automate and implement a new example to get feedback\nBDD Example:\n\n```\n- Feature: User Login\n*As a user I want to login into the Company's website using my existing account so that I can use other features*\n- Scenario Outline: Login with valid credential\nGiven I navigate to \u003cCompany Login Page\u003e\nWhen I input \u003cUsername\u003e\nand I input \u003cPassword\u003e\nand I click Login Button\nThen I should be able to login successfully\n- Examples:\n| Email | Password\n| abc@company.info | password 1\n| abc2@company.info | Password@\n```\n\n\u003e Personal note on implementing BDD and TDD:\n\u003e - Mistakes are that people only implement BDD/TDD practices at **Testing phase** when they implemented automation test. However it should be as early as possible. Using \"BDD\" to only cover automation test is not **BDD**.\n\u003e - BDD helps products and developers realize different scenarios of a same feature, then cover as much as they could at requirement and implementation phase.\n\u003e - BDD borrows * ubiquitous language * concept from domain driven design so that everyone in the team can understand the term the same way.\n\nSource: https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/\n","title":"Behavior Driven Development","short_title":"","description":"Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders.","tags":["agile","behavior-driven-development","testing","ubiquitous-language"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["0xlight"],"date":"Thu Oct 13 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/00_fleeting/202210131000-behavior-driven-development.md","slugArray":["playground","00_fleeting","202210131000-behavior-driven-development"]},{"content":"\n### An Introduction to React Fiber\n\nFiber is the new reconciliation algorithm since React 16, a completely backward-compatible rewrite of the old reconciler (Stack Reconciler).\n\n### Purposes\n- Improved performance by breaking the limits of the call stack. It allows dividing the work into multiple chunks \u0026 divide the rendering work over multiple frames. This lets it pause or restart work conditionally.\n- Control over the priority of the work. Work being divided into smaller chunks mean we can essentially prioritize each chunk based on its context. E.g: Functions that originate from user actions should be processed before less-important background functions.\n- Better suitability for advanced UI (animations, layouts \u0026 gestures) as a result of the priority control.\n- … (some other new features)\n\nBy breaking up the work into smaller chunks that can be paused, resumed, or aborted based on a set priority order, React Fiber helps apps deliver a more fluid experience.\n\nWith the old Stack Reconciler, reconciliation and rendering work weren’t separated \u0026 performed synchronously without interruption. Render changes can only be inserted after current stack was cleared. This often resulted in lagging inputs and choppy frame rates.\n\n### References\n- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-reconciliation/\n-

main categories that most UI libraries fall into\na/ pure:  pure css, no javascript/composite styling, what you write is what you get when compile  (tailwind, SASS), focus on **how they look**\nb/ behavioral: pure javascript for a11y purpose, unstyled (no css at all) components to make them work the same across different browsers (headlessUI, radix, react-aria), in other words - focus on how they work\nc/ style system: predefined components that are built upon a layer of pure css (tailwindUI, bootstrap, mantineUI, daisyUI), **opinionated a.k.a they (the library author) will mostly decide how their components look**  \n\nThe problem with bootstrap\n*\"Why use Tailwind when you already have Bootstrap?\"*\n- Tailwind is not another Bootstrap, a `justify-center` class maps exactly to 1 line of css code, you have total control over what is being shipped to the user, whereas a `.btn` class in Bootstrap expands to +50 line of css styles and custom variables, you can customize it but it will not be a joyful experience.\n\nthe problem with MUI\n-material ui is the hybrid version of (b) and (c) category: it has predefined components that look a certain way, it also has javascript underneath to handle all of its component interaction (datepicker, button, input, etc...) -\u003e it gives you a decent head start but it also limits your ability to go far, once your reach the cap a.k.a \"I want my component to look and behave sightly different then the one in example\" then you start look for solution, tweaks, hacks, workarounds and find out that it will require a huge effort or even sometimes impossible.\n\nTL;DR when in doubt use tailwind, if you're new to css it'll help you learn css faster, if you already know css it'll help you go faster **and** improve the quality of your component

deployments.\n- Put sign-in in its own `\u003cform\u003e` element.\n- Ensure successful form submission (by navigating to a new page or simulating page navigation).\n- Use `autocomplete=\"new-password”` and `id=\"new-password”` for the password input in a sign-up form, and for the new password in a reset-password form.\n- Use autocomplete=\"current-password\" and id=\"current-password\" for a sign-in password input.\n- Provide Show password functionality.\n- Use `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` for password inputs.\n- Don't double-up inputs (e.g forcing users to enter email or password twice)\n- Design forms so the mobile keyboard doesn't obscure inputs or buttons.\n- Ensure forms are usable on mobile: use legible text, and make sure inputs and buttons are large enough to work as touch targets.\n- Maintain branding and style on your sign-up and sign-in pages.\n- Test in the field as well as the lab: build page analytics, interaction analytics, and user-centric performance measurement into your sign-up and sign-in flow.\n- Test across browsers and devices: form behaviour varies significantly across platforms.\n\n###

Pattern**\nTL,DR;\nVersus \"normal\" view\n- A normal view provides ease-of-use and flexibility features, but it DOES NOT speed up data access\n- A Materialized view is the cache of views. It pre-computes, stores, and optimizes data access when created, and automatically refreshes to ensure real-time data availability\n\n**Usecases**\n- In data warehouses that have a large number of complex queries on large tables, consume a lot of time \u0026 resource, materialized views can eliminate the overhead of expensive joins and aggregations by responding to queries by pre-computed results.\n- Especially useful for queries that can be anticipated and repeatedly use the same subquery results.\n\n**Two main refresh strategies**\n1/ Complete refresh\n- Running within one transaction\n- At the beginning, the old data of the materialized view is deleted\n- Then, the new data is inserted by running the underlying SQL query. \n- At the end of the refresh, the transaction is committed, and the new data is visible for all users.\nPros: During this process, users can still use the materialized view and see the old data\nCons: This  process can take a long time as the number of rows that the materialized view contains\n\n2/ Fast refresh (“incremental refresh” would be more appropriate)\nIn most cases, this method is much faster than a Complete Refresh\n- A fast refresh requires having a materialized view log on each of the source tables that are referenced in the materialized view\n- There are several preconditions to enable Fast Refresh, and if only one of them is missing, the Fast Refresh method does not work (can debug by using dbms_mview.explain_mview)\n\n**References**\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/materialized-view\n- https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/dwhsg/refreshing-materialized-views.html#GUID-BB945209-8D69-4FC7-844E-35C9ED7C8A80\n\n#data\n@brain master\n","title":"Materialized View Pattern","short_title":"","description":"Materialized view is the cache of views.

Here are some steps you can take to address technical debt in Scrum:\n\n1. Identify the sources of technical debt in your project. This could be outdated technology, inadequate testing, or a lack of documentation, among other things.\n2. Prioritize the items that have the greatest impact on your team's ability to deliver value. This will help you focus on the most important issues first.\n3. Create a plan to address the technical debt. This could include refactoring code, updating technology, or improving testing processes.\n4. Work on addressing the technical debt during the sprints. This could mean dedicating a portion of each sprint to tackling technical debt, or it could mean making it a priority for the team to work on during their sprints.\n5. Monitor and track the progress of your efforts to address technical debt. This will help you see if your plan is working and adjust it if necessary.\n6. Communicate with stakeholders about the technical debt and your plan to address it.

Using regular expressions as a fairly easy to understand example, let's look at the pattern AB+C (imagine that that plus is a superscript). I would expect to this pattern to accept strings such as \"ABC\", \"ABBC\", \"ABBBC\", etc. A at the start, C at the end, some number of B's in the middle (greater than or equal to one).\n\nIf you think about it, it's almost easier to think about this in terms of a picture. Faking it with text (and that my parentheses are a loopback arc), you can see that A (on the left), is the starting state and C (on the right) is the end state on the right.\n\n```\n      _\n     ( ) \nA --\u003e B --\u003e C\n```\n\nFrom FSAs, you can continue your journey into computational complexity by heading over to the land of Turing Machines.\n\nHowever, you can also use state machines to represent real behaviors and systems. In my world, we use them to model certain workflow of actual people working with components that are extremely intolerant of mistakes in state order. As in, \"A had better happen before C or there will be a very serious problem. Make that be not possible right now.\"\n\n2/ FSA are primarily a **thinking tool**, not a programming technique.\n\nFSA provides a **clear, formal way** to describe and model systems with multiple states and transitions. This is useful in scenarios where systems must respond to a sequence of events.\n\nBeing able to model systems in terms of states and transitions helps developers design clear, maintainable, and bug-free applications.\n\n[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/364193/what-are-finite-state-automata-and-why-should-a-programmer-know-about-them)\n\n### What is the difference between finite state machine and finite automata?\n\nBoth \"Finite State Machine\" FSM and \"Finite Automata\" (or Finite State Automata) FA means same, represents an abstract mathematical model of computation for the class of regular languages. \n\nThe word \"Finite\" significance the presence of the finite amount of memory in the form of the finite number of states Q.\n\nGenerally in formal-theory (or theory of computation), we prefer to use the word \"Automata\" – to emphasise that our machine is 'automatic' machine (self-moving: like our computer) — \"automatic\" in the sense that once you have been defined transition rules, you do not need to apply any explicit intelligent to process strings (you just need to refer transition rules at each step). Remember our ultimate aim behind defining transition machines is to automate the computational task.\n\nBy the way, automata or state-machines are a graphical representation to describe transition rules.\n\nYou can also use \"Transition Tables\" or \"Transition function\" like `δ(q0, a) → q1`. Basically, all uses for the same purpose just to define \"Mappings\". \n\n[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22354706/can-anyone-please-explain-difference-between-finite-state-machine-and-finite-aut)\n\n### How does \"δ:Q×Σ → Q\" read in the definition of a DFA\n\n`×` means Cartesian product (that is a set), and `→` is a mapping.\n`δ: Q×Σ → Q` says `δ` is a transition function that defined mapping from `Q×Σ` to `Q`. Where, Domain of `δ` is `Q×Σ` and Range is `Q`.\n\nNote: [Cartesian Product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) itself a mathematical that all possible order pair (mapping) between two sets. \n\nYou can also say:\n\n`δ` is a transition function that defined mapping between (or say associates) Cartesian product of set of states `Q` and language symbols `Σ` into set of state `Q`. This is abbreviated by `δ:Q×Σ → Q`\n\nHere, `Q` is finite set of states and `Σ` is a finite set of language symbols. \n\nAdditionally in any automated you can represent transition function in tree ways.\n1. [Transition Table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_transition_table#Common_forms)\n2. [Transition graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram) or say state diagram.\n3. Transition function: a finite set of mapping rules. e.g. `{δ(q0, a) → q1, δ(q1, a) → q2}`\n\nIn DFA. `δ:Q×Σ → Q` can also be written like `δ(Q,Σ) → Q` It's similar to function. In `δ` function two input arguments are state `Q` and a language symbol `Σ` and returned value is `Q`. \n\n**What is meaning of `δ(Q,Σ) → Q`**\n\nSuppose in your set of transition function δ you have an element `δ(q0, a) → q1` this means. If the present state is `q0` then by consuming a symbol you can shift to state `q1`. And the state-diagram for `δ(q0, a) → q1`: `(q0)---a---►(q1)`\n\nSome authors write `δ ⊆ Q×Σ → Q` in formal DFA definition that means `δ` is a Partial function (not defined on full Domain `Q×Σ`)\n\n[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14870130/how-does-%ce%b4q%c3%97%ce%a3%e2%86%92q-read-in-the-definition-of-a-dfa-deterministic-finite-automat?noredirect=1\u0026lq=1)\n\n### State machine vs. Workflow\n\n1/ The major difference between a workflow engine and a state machine lies in focus. In a workflow engine, a transition to the next step occurs when a previous action is completed, whilst a state machine needs an external event that will cause branching to the next activity. In other words, the state machine is event-driven and the workflow engine is not. [Source](https://workflowengine.io/blog/workflow-engine-vs-state-machine/)\n\n2/ A state machine (which is a map of states with transitions between them) would allow loops as opposed to a sequential workflow, which precedes down different branches until done.

If it sees a red tile, it knows for sure what its next move is.\n- It's **very strict** and follows only one route to figure out if the path is correct.\n    For example:\n    - If it sees a red tile, it moves forward.\n    - If it sees a blue tile, it turns around. It **never gets confused** and always knows the next step.\n\n#### NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton) Robot:\n- This robot is a little different. When it sees a tile, it can **imagine multiple possibilities** and think about all of them at once.\n- It might say, \"Hmm, when I see a red tile, I could move forward, turn around, or even jump! Let me think about all these options at once.\"\n- The robot **explores multiple paths** at the same time, as if it can split into multiple versions of itself.\n    For example:\n    - When it sees a red tile, it might think, \"I can either move forward or jump over it.\"\n    - It checks **all options** at the same time and decides if the path is correct by looking at all the possibilities.\n\n#### Difference in Capabilities:\n- **DFA Robot**: It's faster because it always knows exactly what to do. But it might need a lot of instructions because it can't explore different options. It has to account for every possible situation.\n- **NFA Robot**: It’s more flexible because it can explore lots of possibilities at the same time. But in the real world, it might take a little longer to check all those options.\n\n#### Key Points:\n- **DFA**: One option at a time, very efficient but can be strict.\n- **NFA**: Many options at once, more flexible but can take more time to figure things out.\n","title":"Automata","short_title":"","description":"Things about automata that devs should know","tags":["automata"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao"],"date":"Tue Oct 22 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/00_fleeting/automata.md","slugArray":["playground","00_fleeting","automata"]},{"content":"Finite State Machines (FSMs) are a crucial concept in computer science and software development, providing a robust method for modeling the behavior of systems. Erlang, a language designed for concurrency, fault tolerance, and distributed computing, offers unique advantages when implementing FSMs. In this note, we'll explore how Erlang excels in handling FSMs, using the Catch Chicken Machine as a practical example.\n\n## Why Erlang?\n\n1. **Concurrency**: Erlang's lightweight processes and efficient message-passing make it ideal for concurrent systems.\n2. **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in mechanisms for error detection and recovery enhance system reliability.\n3. **Distributed Computing**: Native support for distributed systems allows easy scaling and resilience.\n\n## The Catch Chicken Machine: A Practical Example\n\nThe Catch Chicken Machine is a simple yet illustrative example of a finite state machine implemented in Erlang. It models a system where a chicken-catching robot moves between states based on external inputs and internal logic.\n\n## States and Transitions\n\n- **Idle**: The initial state, waiting for a command to start.\n- **Searching**: Actively looking for a chicken.\n- **Catching**: Attempting to catch a detected chicken.\n- **Resting**: Taking a break after a catch or a failed attempt.\n\n## Implementation Practices\n\n1. **Define States and Events**: Clearly define each state and the events that trigger transitions.\n   ```erlang\n   -define(STATES, [idle, searching, catching, resting]).\n   -define(EVENTS, [start, chicken_spotted, chicken_caught, chicken_escaped, rest]).\n   ```\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: Use Erlang's pattern matching to implement transition logic.\n   ```erlang\n   handle_event(start, idle) -\u003e\n       {next_state, searching};\n   handle_event(chicken_spotted, searching) -\u003e\n       {next_state, catching};\n   handle_event(chicken_caught, catching) -\u003e\n       {next_state, resting};\n   handle_event(chicken_escaped, catching) -\u003e\n       {next_state, searching};\n   handle_event(rest, resting) -\u003e\n       {next_state, idle}.\n   ```\n\n3. **Concurrency and Messaging**: Leverage Erlang's messaging capabilities to handle state transitions.\n   ```erlang\n   loop(State) -\u003e\n       receive\n           Event -\u003e\n               {next_state, NewState} = handle_event(Event, State),\n               loop(NewState)\n       end.\n   ```\n\n4. **Fault Tolerance**: Implement error handling to ensure the FSM can recover from unexpected states or failures.\n   ```erlang\n   handle_event(_, _) -\u003e\n       {next_state, idle}.\n   ```\n\n## Benefits of Using Erlang for FSMs\n\n- **Scalability**: Erlang's ability to handle numerous concurrent processes allows the FSM to scale efficiently.\n- **Reliability**: The language's emphasis on fault tolerance ensures that the FSM can recover gracefully from errors.\n- **Clarity**: Pattern matching and clear state definitions make the FSM logic easy to understand and maintain.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nErlang's unique features make it an excellent choice for implementing finite state machines. By following best practices and leveraging the language's strengths, developers can create robust, scalable, and reliable FSMs. The Catch Chicken Machine example demonstrates how Erlang's concurrency, fault tolerance, and clear syntax contribute to effective FSM implementation.

Over the years, many error-handling patterns have evolved in different programming languages.\n\n### 1. Return Codes/Status Codes\n\nThis is one of the most basic forms of error handling and is common in older, low-level programming languages such as C. A function returns a value that indicates whether it succeeded or failed. For example, it might return `0` for success or `-1`for failure. The caller is responsible for checking the return value and handling any errors.\n\nAlways check the return values when using this pattern. Missing a check can easily lead to silent bugs that are hard to trace.\n\n**Example**:\n\n```c\nint divide(int a, int b, int *result) {\n    if (b == 0) {\n        return -1;  // error: division by zero\n    }\n    *result = a / b;\n    return 0;  // success\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int result;\n    if (divide(10, 0, \u0026result) != 0) {\n        printf(\"Error: Division by zero!\\n\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Simple and efficient.\n- Minimal overhead, making it suitable for systems with limited resources.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Error checking can be easily forgotten, leading to silent failures.\n- Leads to code that's cluttered with return value checks.\n\n### 2. Exceptions (Try-Catch)\n\nExceptions are a more modern and structured way of handling errors, used in languages like Python, Java, and C#. When an error occurs, the program \"throws\" an exception, which can be caught and handled using a `try-catch` block. This separates normal flow from error-handling logic.\n\nDon't overuse exceptions for flow control, and **never swallow** exceptions without logging or handling them properly. Always catch specific exceptions rather than using generic ones like `Exception` in Python or `Throwable` in Java.\n\n**Example**:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    print(f\"Error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Clean separation between normal logic and error-handling logic.\n- Handles deep errors without cluttering every function with return value checks.\n- Allows for handling different types of exceptions.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Can add runtime overhead.\n- Misuse can lead to code that’s hard to debug, especially if exceptions are caught but not properly handled.\n\n### 3. Error Objects or Results\n\nThis pattern forces the function to return an object that explicitly represents either a successful result or an error. It is commonly used in functional programming languages like Rust, Haskell, and also in Swift. In Rust, for example, the `Result` type can be `Ok` for success or `Err` for failure.\n\nEmbrace this pattern when available. It forces you to **deal with both success and error cases**explicitly, reducing the likelihood of missed error handling.\n\n**Example** (Rust):\n\n```rust\nfn divide(a: i32, b: i32) -\u003e Result\u003ci32, String\u003e {\n    if b == 0 {\n        return Err(\"Division by zero\".to_string());\n    }\n    Ok(a / b)\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    match divide(10, 0) {\n        Ok(result) =\u003e println!(\"Result: {}\", result),\n        Err(e) =\u003e println!(\"Error: {}\", e),\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Forces explicit error handling, making it harder to ignore errors.\n- More functional and compositional, especially useful for chaining operations.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Can be verbose, especially if multiple layers of functions need to return and propagate `Result` types.\n\n### 4. Assertions\n\nAssertions are a debugging tool that checks if certain conditions hold true. If the assertion fails, the program crashes, usually with a helpful error message. This pattern is mainly used for development and debugging, not for production error handling.\n\n**Don’t use assertions for regular error handling**. They are meant for development and debugging purposes, not for catching user-facing errors in production.\n\n**Example** (Python):\n\n```python\ndef divide(a, b):\n    assert b != 0, \"Division by zero!\"\n    return a / b\n\ndivide(10, 0)  # This will raise an AssertionError\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Simple and effective for catching bugs during development.\n- Forces assumptions to be explicitly stated in the code.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Typically disabled in production, so they don’t handle errors in live environments.\n- Not suitable for recoverable errors.\n\n### 5. Callbacks (Error-First)\n\nIn environments that deal with asynchronous operations, like Node.js, error-first callbacks are a common pattern. The first parameter of the callback is an error (if any), and the second is the result.\n\nWhen using callbacks, **always check the error argument** first. Don’t forget to handle errors properly in every callback.\n\n**Example** (JavaScript):\n\n```javascript\nfunction divide(a, b, callback) {\n    if (b === 0) {\n        return callback(new Error(\"Division by zero\"), null);\n    }\n    callback(null, a / b);\n}\n\ndivide(10, 0, (err, result) =\u003e {\n    if (err) {\n        console.error(err.message);\n    } else {\n        console.log(result);\n    }\n});\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Works well for asynchronous operations.\n- Error handling is explicit.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Can lead to \"callback hell\" when multiple asynchronous operations are nested.\n\n### 6. Promise-Based Error Handling\n\nPromises are an evolution of callbacks, mainly used in asynchronous programming (e.g., JavaScript). They allow for cleaner handling of asynchronous operations, using `.then()` for success and `.catch()` for errors.\n\nUse Promises to make your asynchronous code more readable. Pay attention to the **promise chain**, and always handle `.catch()` for potential errors.\n\n**Example** (JavaScript):\n\n```javascript\nfunction divide(a, b) {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u003e {\n        if (b === 0) reject(new Error(\"Division by zero\"));\n        else resolve(a / b);\n    });\n}\n\ndivide(10, 0)\n    .then(result =\u003e console.log(result))\n    .catch(error =\u003e console.error(error.message));\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Cleaner and more readable than callbacks, especially when using `async/await`.\n- Easier to handle chained asynchronous operations.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Errors in promise chains can be tricky to debug if `.catch()` blocks are misused or omitted.\n\n### 7. Pattern Matching\n\nPattern matching is used in functional languages like Haskell, Rust, and Scala to handle different outcomes of a computation. This allows developers to decompose data structures and handle each case explicitly.\n\nPattern matching is powerful, but be sure to **handle all possible cases**. If you miss one, your program might crash or behave unexpectedly.\n\n**Example** (Rust):\n\n```rust\nfn divide(a: i32, b: i32) -\u003e Result\u003ci32, String\u003e {\n    if b == 0 {\n        Err(\"Division by zero\".to_string())\n    } else {\n        Ok(a / b)\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    match divide(10, 0) {\n        Ok(result) =\u003e println!(\"Result: {}\", result),\n        Err(e) =\u003e println!(\"Error: {}\", e),\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Forces exhaustive handling of different error cases.\n- Provides a clear and readable syntax for handling both success and error cases.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Can be overcomplicated for simple error handling needs.\n\n### 8. Panic (Crash)\n\nSome languages like Rust and Go use panics for non-recoverable errors. A panic results in the program crashing. In Rust, panics can be caught, but in general, this pattern is reserved for situations where the program can't reasonably continue.\n\n**Use panics sparingly**. They should only be used for truly exceptional, unrecoverable errors, not for ordinary cases like bad user input.\n\n**Example** (Go):\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc divide(a, b int) int {\n    if b == 0 {\n        panic(\"Division by zero!\")\n    }\n    return a / b\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(divide(10, 0))\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Useful for catching serious, non-recoverable errors.\n- Forces developers to think about critical error scenarios.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Crashes the program, which may not be desirable in production.\n- Can be overused in scenarios where graceful error handling is possible.\n","title":"Error Handling Patterns","short_title":"","description":"Quick note on error handling patterns in programming languages","tags":["go","error"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao"],"date":"Mon Oct 14 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/00_fleeting/error-handling-patterns.md","slugArray":["playground","00_fleeting","error-handling-patterns"]},{"content":"\nGradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm in machine learning.

Founders are celebrated for leaving stable jobs and pouring their lives into an “uncertain” and “high-risk” venture. This mythos justifies the enormous equity stakes founders hold compared to early employees who take very similar risks by joining an unproven startup.\n\nHowever, there's a lesser-known aspect of the startup ecosystem that significantly shifts the risk landscape: **founder liquidity**.\n\n### My Experience in Early Stage Startups\n\nBeing a software engineer who has a strong preference for creativity, problem-solving, and autonomy I realized during college that very big and slow companies were not for me. I joined a startup straight out of college as employee number 8 and immediately knew I made the right choice. My skills were improving week over week, I was responsible for shipping important features and was given a lot of responsibility right out of the gate.\n\nI eventually got pretty good at choosing strong founders to join and building great products from zero to one which in turn spawned a cycle of joining a team early, finding success, the company gets too big, and then I leave to do it again elsewhere. I have been an early or first engineer at five different companies and have had three liquidity events in a 9-year career.\n\n### The Reality of Founder Risk \u0026 Liquidity\n\n**Founder liquidity** refers to the practice where founders sell a portion of their shares during a new funding round. This allows them to \"take chips off the table,\" securing personal financial stability while continuing to build the company with a fresh influx of venture capital. This practice is often kept under wraps, discussed in closed boardrooms, and only briefly mentioned in investor updates. You would really only know this happened if you were a founder, investor, or had direct access to the cap table.\n\nWhy is it a secret that founders get liquidity in many venture rounds? Because it undermines the narrative of the founder who is \"all-in.\" The story of the founder who mortgaged their house and lived on ramen noodles for years is compelling. It garners admiration and sympathy, attracting top talent willing to work for lower salaries in exchange for a piece of the pie. If it were widely known that founders could de-risk their financial position while their employees remained all-in, it might change how startups are perceived and valued.\n\nThis is a graph of cash compensation over time modeled off of a real scenario that happened over 4 years. This level of founder liquidity is fairly common.\n\n![](assets/founder-liquidity-chart-1.webp)\n\nThe founder in this scenario was offered $400,000 of liquidity at Series A and $750,000 at Series B and encouraged to do so by their board of investors to de-risk their own life. Liquidity was not offered to any employees and the fact that this happened at all was only revealed to people on the cap table.\n\nAnother more well-known and extreme example was in the case of Adam Neumann the founder of WeWork - Neumann was able to cash out over 2B in secondary meanwhile not a single WeWork employee was able to capitalize on their equity stakes. They were told internally how much their shares were worth at each raise, and the hype surrounding each raise continued as WeWork sky-rocketed in valuation. Neumann was smart to de-risk his position by selling as much secondary as possible during the ascent but only attempted to structure a tender offer for non-founding employees in 2019 **_nine years_** after WeWork was created. That tender offer with SoftBank fell through and employees were left with absolutely nothing. ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2020/04/13/wework-employees-feel-abandoned-and-angry-as-softbank-ditches-its-3-billion-buyout-offer?ref=stefantheard.com))\n\nThe part about these stories that feels unfair is not that the founders are getting liquidity - it's that they are the _only ones_ getting liquidity. There are other stories like [Hopin](https://techfundingnews.com/unravelling-virtual-dreams-the-rise-and-fall-of-hopin/?ref=stefantheard.com) where the founder takes tens or hundreds of millions in secondary just to later sell the company for less than the [liquidation preference](https://www.holloway.com/g/venture-capital/sections/liquidation-preference?ref=stefantheard.com) stack and leave the employees with a grand total of zero dollars for their equity.\n\n### Right-Sizing Perception\n\nThere are a lot of odd perceptions surrounding founder liquidity:\n\n1. Investors and founders both tend to think that if employees knew founders were getting liquidity that that would negatively impact employee morale (**it wouldn’t**)\n2. Founders often feel guilty that they are getting liquidity (**they shouldn’t**)\n3. Investors think that the liquidity could taint the perception of future investors negatively (**it doesn’t**)\n4. Investors, founders, and employees all believe that founders are taking more risk than early employees (**this isn’t true once founders have exclusive access to liquidity**)\n\nWhen I found out that my founders got access to liquidity during our series A my first thought was “That is awesome, they deserve it” my second thought was “I wonder why employees didn’t get access to any liquidity?” and then my third thought was “Is this a secret? It seems like a secret. That’s weird”. I was the only employee who knew about it because I had incidental access to the cap table.\n\nOnce I found out, I was curious if I was reading it correctly, so I immediately went to one of the founders and asked “Did you get a bit of liquidity during the series A?”. His reaction went from surprise to confusion and then he said “Yeah I did, a little bit”. I said “Wow that is awesome, congrats! It has to be nice to be able to backfill some salary after grinding for a couple of years” and he said, “Yeah, definitely.”. I could sense relief after chatting about it with him, almost like he felt better knowing that I knew about it. I never felt negative, had low morale, or anything of the sort, I trusted in my founding team and I was happy for them. If it were the case that I was lied to about it, then I would be upset and have low morale but that would be a result of being lied to - not liquidity access.\n\n### Balancing the Scales\n\nAs of 4 months ago I left a very successful stealth startup (which grew to 40M in ARR in two years) to become a founder and that is when it clicked - I expected to feel stressed, pressured, and the weight of all of the risk I was taking. What actually happened is that I realized I could have been a founder 6 years ago and I would have been taking a similar amount of risk as I did then as the first employee at [tackle.io](http://tackle.io/?ref=stefantheard.com).\n\nMy intention now, as a founder, is to balance the risk for early employees by being transparent, more generous with equity, and only taking liquidity if I can also offer it to employees as well.\n\n- Our employee option pool is 20% which is double the average\n- We have a 3-month equity cliff which is 9 months sooner than the average.\n- We allow employees to exercise options up to 10 years after they leave instead of 90 days.\n- Our equity packages vest over 3 years instead of the industry standard 4-year period.\n\nThese changes are great, but nowhere near enough. In my view, every internal announcement of a new round at venture-backed companies should be accompanied by education and transparency around liquidity. Without transparency, none of the misperceptions have a chance of going away. The net result is that employees have a fundamentally misguided idea of the risk landscape as it shifts beneath their feet.\n\nIf you work at a venture-backed company the next time a round is announced ask if the founders took any liquidity. Do it anonymously if you have to. This question should become so common that founders and investors become transparent by default. If they say no, great - no change to risk profiles. If they say yes - great, employees are operating with the same information as the founders and investors. This levels the playing field and allows employees to assess if they are still in a lower risk bucket than the founders, or if they are now taking significantly more risk than the founders.  \n  \nIf employees realize they are taking more risk than the founders, maybe they'll ask for more compensation, maybe they'll congratulate the founders and move on with their day, maybe they'll start yelling: \"I'M TAKING SO MUCH RISK, IT'S SO HARD TO BUILD A COMPANY, I DON'T EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY!!!\". And maybe they're right.\n\n---\nhttps://www.stefantheard.com/silicon-valleys-best-kept-secret-founder-liquidity\n","title":"Founder Liquidity","short_title":"","description":"Founder liquidity is a secret that founders and investors don't want you to know","tags":["startup","shares","founder"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao"],"date":"Fri Oct 11 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/00_fleeting/founder-liquidity.md","slugArray":["playground","00_fleeting","founder-liquidity"]},{"content":"ChatGPT, an advanced language model by OpenAI, offers a unique way to interact with AI. The quality of results depends on the information and how well you craft your input. Then, it’s essential to understand how to talk with ChatGPT effectively.  \n\n## How can you talk with ChatGPT?\nStart by entering a message or prompt to begin the conversation. It's like a text-based chat with another person, but your interlocutor is AI. A prompt can include instructions, questions, context, inputs, or examples. Using these elements effectively can improve the quality of the results.\n\n## How AI responds to the prompts?\nAI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini use natural language processing and machine learning. This allows them to understand conversational prompts, making the quality of the prompt crucial for the output's relevance and quality.\n\nTo effectively communicate and maximize the potential of ChatGPT, you need some strategies:\n\n1. **Understand Your Objective**: Clearly define what you want to achieve with your prompt. Is it information, creativity, or problem-solving?\n2. **Keep It Clear and Concise**: Avoid overly complex or vague prompts. Clarity leads to better AI responses.\n3. **Context Matters**: Provide enough background for the AI to understand the scenario but avoid unnecessary information.\n4. **Experiment and Iterate**: Don’t hesitate to refine your prompts based on the responses you get. Iteration is key to finding the most effective wording.\n5. **Consider Your Audience**: Tailor your prompt based on who will interact with or benefit from the AI’s response.\n6. **Evaluate and Adapt**: Continuously assess the effectiveness of your prompts and be ready to adapt as needed.\n\nHere are two examples of prompt input for thesis topic about DeFi, and the resulting output from ChatGPT. It is obvious that instead of listing like the output of prompt 1, that of prompt 2 provides more valueable and usable information. \n\n![](assets/how-to-talk-to-chatgpt-effectively_compare.webp)\n\nWhat make the difference of these two?\n\n## What are 5 principles of an effective prompt?\n### Give Direction\nThe direction should describe the desired style in detail, or reference a relevant persona. You can design effective prompts for various simple tasks by using commands to instruct the model what you want to achieve, such as \"Write\", \"Classify\", \"Summarize\", \"Translate\", \"Order\", etc. You should also provide the context, which includes specifying a particular time period, geographical location, the role you want to play, or any other relevant limitations. \n\n### Specify Format\nBe very specific about the instruction and task you want the model to perform. The more descriptive and detailed the prompt is, the better the results. This is particularly important when you have a desired outcome or style of generation you are seeking.\n\nDefine what rules to follow, and the required structure of the response.\n\n### Provide Examples\nUsing prompts and examples can enhance the clarity of your question and guide Chat GPT in understanding the desired output. By providing sample inputs or expected formats, you can communicate your expectations effectively and receive more tailored responses.\n\n![](assets/how-to-talk-to-chatgpt-effectively_prompt-1.webp)\n\n### Evaluate Quality\nYou need to identify errors and rate responses, testing what drives performance.\n\n### Divide Labor\nYou should split tasks into multiple steps, chained together for complex goals.\n\n![](assets/how-to-talk-to-chatgpt-effectively_clean-shot-2024-06-11-at-17-07-19-2x.webp)\n\n## Prompt Pattern\n### Output customization\n**1. Give persona**\n- **Use case**: Get better outputs by simulating an expert or specific role.\n- **Structure and Key Ideas:**\n    - Act as persona X and provide outputs that they would create.\n    - Explain \u003cterm\u003e for \u003cpersonaX\u003e\n- Example\n    - Explain the value chain model for a business freshman.\n    - Please list all of the Defi topic that business student can use for bachelor thesis.\n\n**2. Give template**\n- **Use case**: Get the output in a specific structure\n- **Structure and Key Ideas:** Provide a template with placeholders for ChatGPT to fill in.\n- **Example**: Please list all of the Defi topic that business student can use for bachelor thesis. Each topic you propose must include the problems that the thesis solve, the data that the thesis would use.Return the results in this format:\n    - Topic name: [Topic name]\n    - Problem: [List of problems]\n    - Data need: [List of data metrics]\n- Output\n    \n    ![template.png](assets/how-to-talk-to-chatgpt-effectively_template.webp)\n\n  **3. Provide Recipe**\n- **Use case**: When you want achieve a specific end result in a provided sequence of steps.\n- **Structure and Key Ideas**:\n    - Specify the desired outcome and any known constraints or partial information.\n    - **Example pattern**: Provide step-by-step recipe to \u003cdo something\u003e: \u003clist your self-defined sequence of steps\u003e\n- **Example**:  Provide a step-by-step data analysis recipe to study the factors that affect employee satisfaction: 1. Identify problems 2. Data Collection 3. Data Cleaning 4. Data Analysis 5. Data Visualization.\n- **Output**\n    \n    ![](assets/how-to-talk-to-chatgpt-effectively_recepie.webp)\n\n### Context control\n- **Use case**: When you want to maintain and manage the context of the conversation to ensure coherence and relevance in ongoing interactions.\n- **Structure and Key Ideas:** Instruct ChatGPT to remember specific details from the conversation and use them in future responses.\n- **Example**: Please remember for every the data analysis request I want to solve by using R.\n\n### Interaction\n- **Use case**: You allow  ChatGPT to drive the interaction, ensuring that it gathers all necessary information to provide a comprehensive response.\n- **Structure and Key Ideas:** Instruct ChatGPT to ask a series of questions aimed at achieving a specific outcome.\n- **Example**: From now on, I would like you to ask me questions to diagnose and solve a computer performance issue. Please ask question once at a time. When you have enough information, provide a summary of the problem and a solution. For example, 'Is your computer running slow all the time or only during certain activities?\n\n- ![](assets/how-to-talk-to-chatgpt-effectively_clean-shot-2024-06-21-at-14-02-56-2x.webp)\n","title":"How to talk to ChatGPT effectively","short_title":"","description":"This post presents technique to improve the your output when prompting ChatGPT.","tags":["ai","prompt","chatgpt"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["minh_cloud"],"date":"Fri Jun 21 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/00_fleeting/how-to-talk-to-chatgpt-effectively.md","slugArray":["playground","00_fleeting","how-to-talk-to-chatgpt-effectively"]},{"content":"\nWhenever you dive into a topic, there's always a mix of what you know and what's new to you.  It is important to leverage what you already know, learn new information related to it, and see the connection between them. When building memo.d.foundation, our team employs the Zettelkasten Method to streamline all our memos, enhancing reader understanding and engagement.\n\n## Zettelkasten Method\n### What is Zettelkasten Method?\nBasically, the Zettelkasten Method revolves around capturing one idea per note and housing them all in one spot. You label and connect related concepts using tags and URL citations.\n\n![](assets/organize-team-know-how-with-zettelkasten-method_untitled-7.webp)\n\n### Components of a note\n1. **A unique identifier**. This gives your Zettel an unambiguous address. For example: unique ID, URL \n2. **The body of the Zettel**. This is where you write down what you want to capture: The piece of knowledge.\n3. **References**. At the bottom of each Zettel, you either reference the source of the knowledge you capture or leave it blank if you capture your own thoughts.\n\n![](assets/organize-team-know-how-with-zettelkasten-method_untitled-8.webp)\n\n### Types of note included in Zettelkasten\nThere are several different types of notes that you can add into your Zettelkasten. Here’s a quick overview:\n\n1. **Fleeting Notes:** These are for quick, temporary notes that capture in-the-moment ideas and learnings. They're not meant to be comprehensive or polished, but are meant to capture your thoughts so that you can refine them later.\n2. **Literature Notes**: When you learn something from reading, create a literature note. These notes capture the key points and ideas from the books, articles, or other sources that you're studying. Remember to keep each literature note a single idea, as opposed to a collection of learnings from what you read.\n3. **Permanent Notes:** These are the notes that you want to keep for the long-term. They’re made up of the notes you’ve grouped and connected together. Think of it like a summarization of your ideas.\n4. **Reference Notes:** These notes act as “connectors” within your Zettelkasten. Think of them as the table of contents or legend that tell you where to find what information, or which notes connect with which. For example, if you’re using a star to mark notes that came from the same book, you can define that in a reference note. If you’re using a digital Zettelkasten, you might not need to create reference notes.\n\n### How the **Zettelkasten Method improve the way we think and our writing skill**\n- **Clarity in Thinking**: Writing forces you to clarify your point, helping you stick to it coherently.\n- **Consistent Development**: Writing down thoughts prevents mental leaps, ensuring consistent development of ideas.\n- **Improved Memorization**: Putting thoughts on paper aids memorization.\n- **Guarding Against Bias**: Written thoughts remain unchanged, tackling hindsight bias effectively.\n\n## How the team applied the Zettelkasten method\n### The tags system\nWhen a user enters Homepage, all the tags are listed on the sidebar and nested in the section Popular Tags. Each tag represents a topic and contains all the post of that topic. All the memo will attached with at least 3 tags that are related to the memo topics which allow readers to find content easier and look for connections to other notes.\n\n![](assets/organize-team-know-how-with-zettelkasten-method_clean-shot-2024-05-02-at-16-30-48-2x.webp)\n\nWhen readers choose a tag, all the related post will be listed, with chart on the right side to show how all post are linked with each others and the tag. \n\n![](assets/organize-team-know-how-with-zettelkasten-method_clean-shot-2024-05-02-at-16-48-38-2x.webp)\n\n### The Map of content\nOur team use the Zettelkasten method to organize the map of content by usiing Obsidian. All of the files are stored in the form of markdown first, then they will be categorized into certain topics. The map of content provides a high-level view of interconnected notes which offers a flexible and connected way to organize notes. \n\n![](assets/organize-team-know-how-with-zettelkasten-method_clean-shot-2024-06-25-at-17-20-27-2x.webp)\n","title":"Organize team know-how with Zettelkasten Method","short_title":"","description":"At memo.d.foundation, we use the Zettelkasten Method to enhance engagement by capturing one idea per note and connecting concepts with tags and citations.

Traits play a crucial role in achieving code reusability, abstraction, and flexibility.\n\n## Understanding Traits\nIn Rust, a trait is a collection of methods that can be implemented by types to define shared behavior. Think of traits as a way to express what abilities a type should have, without dictating its internal structure. This promotes a high degree of abstraction and allows for code that is more generic and adaptable.\nTraits are similar to a feature often called `interfaces` in other languages, although with some differences.\n\n```rust\ntrait Shape {\n    fn area(\u0026self) -\u003e f64;\n}\n```\nIn the example above, we define a trait named `Shape` with a single method, `area`. This trait can then be implemented by various types to provide their own implementation of the `area` method.\n\n## Implementing Traits\nTo use a trait, a type must implement it by providing its own implementation for each of the trait's methods. This is achieved through the `impl` keyword.\n\n```rust\nstruct Circle {\n    radius: f64,\n}\n\nimpl Shape for Circle {\n    fn area(\u0026self) -\u003e f64 {\n        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius\n    }\n}\n\n```\nNow, instances of `Circle` can leverage the functionality provided by the `Shape` trait.\n\n## Default Implementation\nRust allows you to provide default implementations for trait methods. This means that implementing types can choose to override the default behavior if needed. Let's enhance our `Shape` trait with a default method for `perimeter`:\n\n```rust\ntrait Shape {\n    fn area(\u0026self) -\u003e f64;\n\n    fn perimeter(\u0026self) -\u003e f64 {\n        0.0 // Default implementation for perimeter\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Circle {\n    radius: f64,\n}\n\nimpl Shape for Circle {\n    fn area(\u0026self) -\u003e f64 {\n        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nNow, any type implementing `Shape` will automatically have a default `perimeter` method, but it can choose to provide its own implementation.\n\n## Trait as Parameters\nTraits can be used as parameters to functions, enabling polymorphism and enhancing the flexibility of your code. Consider a function that calculates and prints the area of any type implementing the `Shape` trait:\n\n```rust\nfn print_area(shape: impl Shape) {\n    println!(\"Area: {}\", shape.area());\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let circle = Circle { radius: 3.0 };\n    print_area(circle);\n}\n```\n\nHere, the `print_area` function takes any type that implements the `Shape` trait as a parameter. This allows us to use the function with various shapes without modifying its code.\n\n## Trait Bound\nTo make functions even more flexible, you can use trait bounds to specify that a generic type must implement a certain trait. For instance:\n\n```rust\nfn print_area\u003cT: Shape\u003e(shape: T) {\n    println!(\"Area: {}\", shape.area());\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let circle = Circle { radius: 3.0 };\n    print_area(circle);\n}\n```\nNow, the `print_area` function can accept any type `T` as long as it implements the `Shape` trait.\n\n\n## Conclusion\nTraits in Rust provide a powerful mechanism for defining shared behavior, promoting code reuse and adding polymorphism in our code. By understanding how to implement traits, provide default behavior, use traits as parameters, and apply trait bounds, you can leverage this feature to write more modular and adaptable Rust code.\n","title":"Rust Trait","short_title":"","description":"Rust's **trait** system is a powerful feature that enables developers to define shared behavior across different types.
