Explore how the model breaks down software architecture into comprehensible levels—Context, Container, Component, and Code—and offers guidelines on creating effective diagrams. Real-world examples illustrate the application of the C4 model, making it an invaluable tool for creating a shared understanding and ensuring clear, meaningful communication among all parties involved.","tags":["software-design","software-architecture","graphical-notation"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["jim"],"date":"Thu May 23 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/topics/architecture/c4-modelling.md","slugArray":["playground","topics","architecture","c4-modelling"]},{"content":"","title":"Command Pattern","short_title":"","description":"Command is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object.
