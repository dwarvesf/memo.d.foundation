Sketch proof: Let's \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en\u003c/code\u003e be the number of nodes in a complete binary tree and let \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003el_k\u003c/code\u003e denote the number of nodes on level \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003ek\u003c/code\u003e, where the levels are numbered 1,2,3, ..., h. The last level, \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eh\u003c/code\u003e represents the height of the tree. Note that: \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003el_k=2l_{k-1}\u003c/code\u003e, i.e. each level has exactly twice as many nodes as the previous level (since each internal node has exactly two children). \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003el_1=1\u003c/code\u003e i.e. on the \"first level\" we have only node (the root node). Let's expand several case to find out the recurrence/pattern, \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003el_2=2, l_3=4,l_4=8,l_5=16,l_6=32...\u003c/code\u003e so the recurrence solves to \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003el_k=2^{k-1}\u003c/code\u003e. Note also that the leaves are at the last level \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003el_h\u003c/code\u003e, where h is the height of the tree, so from the previous bullets we know that the last level has \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003el_h=2^{h-1}\u003c/code\u003e nodes. The total number of nodes, \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en\u003c/code\u003e, in the tree is equal to the sum of the nodes on all the levels: $1+2^1+2^2+ ... + 2^{h-1}=n\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003e, again let's expand several case to find out the recurrence on the left hand-side of the equation. We try with $$h=0, \\quad \\therefore 2^0 =1$$$$h=1, \\quad \\therefore 2^0+2^1=3$$$$h=2, \\quad \\therefore 2^0+2^1+2^2=7$$$$h=3, \\quad \\therefore 2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3=15$$so the recurrence is $2^h-1\u003c/code\u003e. Therefore: \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003e$2^h-1=n$$ $$\\therefore 2^h=n+1$$ $$\\therefore lg2^h=lg(n+1)$$ $$\\therefore  hlg2= lg(n+1)$$ $$\\therefore h=lg(n+1)$$ Ok, so now we know the height of the tree we can do one more thing that is to compute the number of leaves \u003c/code\u003el_h\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003ein the tree, we observed earlier that\u003c/code\u003el_h=l^{h-1}\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003e so we can substitute the value of h in this expressions $2^{h-1}=2^h/2^1=2^{lg(n+1)}/2=(n+1)/2\u003c/code\u003e. In conclusion, for a complete binary tree \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eh\u003c/code\u003e is \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(lgn)\u003c/code\u003e and the number of leaves \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003el_h\u003c/code\u003e is roughly half of the nodes \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003e(n+1)/2\u003c/code\u003e.

There's obviously safety issues associated with landing planes, and planes taking off. And so there are constraints associated with the system, that have to be obeyed. And we have to build these constraints in, and the checks for these constraints into our data structure. - What we'd like to do is reserve requests for landings, and each of them are going to specify landing time called \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003et\u003c/code\u003e. So, in particular we're going to add \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003et\u003c/code\u003e to the set \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eR\u003c/code\u003e of landing times if no other landings are scheduled within \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003ek\u003c/code\u003e minutes (k can either be constant or variable that will be changed depends on other business logic, but for simplicity we'll assume k is constant). So we need to be able to perform an insert operation to the data structure. - We have the current notion of time, everytime we have a plane that's already landed, we'd like to remove that landing from the set \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eR\u003c/code\u003e. So every once in a while, as time increments, we're going to be checking the data structure maybe 30 seconds or 1 minute, it doesn't matter, the fact that matters here is we must be able to perform a delete operation on the data structure. - So we have set \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eR\u003c/code\u003e described as above, we don't quite know how to implement it yet.

We're going to shoot them down with respsect to not being able to make the efficiency requirement of \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(lgn)\u003c/code\u003e time for all attached operations. - Unsorted list/array: Almost everything we want to do on this data structure is linear. Although for adding it only take constant time but to do the \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003ek\u003c/code\u003e minutes check it's \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(n)\u003c/code\u003e time since the data have no order so we have to check with every other elements. Also for deletion, we have to traversed the whole data structure in the worst case (at the end of array) in order to find the element that we're going to delete. So basically, it's terrible. - Sorted list/array: I bet binary search is the first thing comes into your mind with this data structure. For the array implementation, yes we can do that to find the desired position to insert in \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(lgn)\u003c/code\u003e time and do the \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003ek\u003c/code\u003e minutes check in \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(1)\u003c/code\u003e time but still take \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(n)\u003c/code\u003e time to do the insertion because possibily we have to shift every index after that, symmetrically the same is true for deletion. So it's almost what we want, if we can somehow skip the \"shift index\" work if we can manage our data in a more strictful structure. Actually in the list implementation, we don't have to do the \"shift index\" work but we can not do the \"go to the middle point\" operation since there's no indexes and we're only maintaing references a.k.a pointers. Give yourself a view of combining the key properties of a sorted array and linked list, that's the good things about the BST when it enables binary search as well as remove the \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(n)\u003c/code\u003e time \"shifting\" index work after the data structure is modified. - Heaps: Because of the logic of heap insertion and deletion methods, and the invariant of max/min heap (all children node must be larger/less than their direct parent) is fairly simple therefore fairly weak, each time we go left or right on the traversal we're not effectively cut off the all the unnecessary nodes, so to do the \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003ek\u003c/code\u003e minutes check it's still take \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(n)\u003c/code\u003e time - that is we have to traverse every elements one by one in the heap. So it fails our requirement. - Hash table: Or dictionaries, hash map, whatever you wanna call it, supports \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(1)\u003c/code\u003e insertion, deletion, search exact all by a given key. But keys are not placed in order, actually they're in a randomized order so again if we want to do the \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003ek\u003c/code\u003e minutes check it still \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(n)\u003c/code\u003e time. The good old hash table fails our requirement too.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe beauty of a BST is that we can augment the tree to do more work as necessary without changing the efficiency of the attached methods. In short, we can easily do the \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003ek\u003c/code\u003e minutes check while finding the place to insert.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis should give us a sense of the richness of the BST structure, we can have nodes to store more data in them than just these common pointers. Having this notion of augmentation on the data structure is very good, because of design admendments so specifications never stay the same, like we're working for someone, and they never really tell us what they want, they might but they will change their mind later on, so in that case we're going to change our mind too and do the augmentation. I'll take an extra example requirements added upon our \"runway reservation system\" problem above, we need to compute \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003erank(t)\u003c/code\u003e that is how many planes are scheduled to land at times less than or equal to \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003et\u003c/code\u003e, perfectly reasonable additional requirement and it wasn't part of the original spec.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWith the notion of the aumented BST, we can refer to the normal BST as the vanilla BST such that each node encapsulates common basic fields like left,right pointer, key... while the aumented BSTs are usually bring together other fields or callbacks needed to make the algorithms work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf you're interested in the implementations of BST you can search your own in the internet, today we're going to focus only on a method to balance BST.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"bst-needs-to-be-balanced\"\u003eBST needs to be balanced!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlmost operations for a vanilla BST is O(h) where h is the height of the BST but what we want is \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(lgn)\u003c/code\u003e, so if \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eh = lgn\u003c/code\u003e where n is the total number of nodes in the BST then we will have \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(lgn)\u003c/code\u003e for operations attached to the BST which will truly satisfied our requirement for the \"runway reservation system\" problem. We have a concept of the balanceness of a tree, to say that a tree is balanced that is it's height must be \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(lgn)\u003c/code\u003e, because almost . Because of the invariant of the BST that is not related to the height of the tree so that BST can become totally skewed to the right/left which is essentially a linked list and we know what's the problem with a linked list. Now this becomes our new problem as obstacles that we have to solve before we can have a data structure that efficiently acchieve \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(lgn)\u003c/code\u003e time in all attached operations in most of the time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-height-of-a-node\"\u003eThe height of a node\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe new question is, what do we need to do in order to guarantee the height of a BST to be \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003elgn\u003c/code\u003e. And before getting to methods that help us to actually do that, I think it's useful to discuss about height of the BST or in general height of a node within a BST because height of node root is also height of the BST.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI will give out a hint that AVL require each node to store an additional integer field call \u003ccode\u003eheight\u003c/code\u003e to store the height of each node, because the algorithm need to know that information instaneously in order to effecienly balance the tree (Simply we can't afford to go down the tree or sub-trees if you will to compute the height every time we need it). For a more intuitive view, let's look at the following picture:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/content/playground/topics/data/assets/self-balanced-bsts---avl-trees_height-of-a-node-in-a-bst.webp\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe need to update the height of each node in the AVL tree every once in awhile whenever insertions or deletions happen on the tree a.k.a the tree structure is modified.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-balance-bst\"\u003eHow to balance BST?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBSTs are augmented and added invariants in many different ways in order to achieve balanceness in their height and they have a common name \"Self-balance binary search tree\", the most famous are AVL trees which we're going to talk about today, Red-Black trees, Splay trees, treaps. Each type of self-balance BST either has their own idea (Red-Black trees have the idea of coloring nodes with red or black) or common idea (the node rotation is commonly used in variants of self balance BST) to achieve balanceness in height.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"avl-tree\"\u003eAVL tree\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA little bit information about the origin of this data structure:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNamed after two Soviet inventors \u003cstrong\u003eA\u003c/strong\u003edelson-\u003cstrong\u003eV\u003c/strong\u003eelsky a computer scientist and \u003cstrong\u003eL\u003c/strong\u003eandis a mathematician.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt was the first self-balance BST ever to be invented and was the original way people found to keep trees balanced back in the '60s so they're kind of the simplest among others.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAVL trees are often compared with Red-Black trees because both support the same set of operations and take \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(lgn)\u003c/code\u003e time for the basic operations.

In my humble opinion, It's important to understand how this is achieved by the invariant of the AVL tree in order to fully understand the idea of AVL trees, so I'll try my best to proove this is true:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe first claim is that \u003ccode\u003eAVL trees are balanced\u003c/code\u003e, balanced means height is always \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(lgn)\u003c/code\u003e, so we're just going to assume for now that we can somehow achieve this property and we want to prove that it implies that the height is at most some constant times \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(lgn)\u003c/code\u003e while we know it's at least \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(lgn)\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLet's think about the worst case for height of an AVL tree, say if we have \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en\u003c/code\u003e nodes how could we make the AVL tree as high as possible? Or conversely, if we have a particular height, how could we make it have as few nodes as possible? That'd be like the sparsest or the least balanced situation for AVL trees.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo achieve the worst case, we can do this: For every node, let's the right side have a height of $1$ larger than the left side or symmetrically we can do the same on the conversely but I'll only take one example here.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe're going to define \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en_{h}\u003c/code\u003e is the minimum number of nodes that's possible in an AVL tree of height \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eh\u003c/code\u003e. This is sort of the inverse that we care about, but if we can solve the inverse, we can solve the thing. What we really care about is, for \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en\u003c/code\u003e nodes, how large can the height be, we wanna prove that is bounded to \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(lgn)\u003c/code\u003e. But it'll be a lot easier to think about the reverse, which is, if we fix the height to be \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eh\u003c/code\u003e then what's the fewest nodes that we can pack in? Because for a worst case of a BST a right/left degenerated BST, we have a height of \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en\u003c/code\u003e so we only need to put \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en\u003c/code\u003e nodes and we see that woulld be really bad. What we prefer is a situation where with heigh \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eh\u003c/code\u003e, we have to put in $2^h$ nodes and that would be perfect balance, so when we take the inverse from that exponential equation we get a logarithm.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImagine a case where we want to build an AVL tree with a fixed height, and we want to have as few nodes as possible. If we have a tree with a big height and very few nodes, \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eh\u003c/code\u003e is going to be bad when we write it as a function of \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en\u003c/code\u003e so those trees are unbalanced - big height, small number of nodes. So we will try to build up the next presentation of the AVL tree with minimum number of nodes for each level, let's look at the following picture:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/content/playground/topics/data/assets/self-balanced-bsts---avl-trees_minimum-number-of-nodes-for-an-avl-tree-of-height-h.webp\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExpanding the example to level 4,5,6,7 then you will regconize the pattern/recurrence. If we want to build an AVL tree with as few nodes as possible and height \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eh\u003c/code\u003e, we start with the root and then at the right we build an AVL tree of height \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eh-1\u003c/code\u003e and at the left, we build an AVL tree of height \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eh-2\u003c/code\u003e, because of the fact that we were also try to build left AVL sub-tree and right AVL sub-tree with minimum number of nodes then it turns out that the whole tree must has minimum number of nodes. Look at the following picture:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/content/playground/topics/data/assets/self-balanced-bsts---avl-trees_the-best-way-to-build-a-tall-avl-tree-with-as-few-nodes-as-possible.webp\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuppose we want to write the number of nodes as a function of height, we have \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en_h=n_{h-2}+n_{h-1}+1\u003c/code\u003e as the recurrence with the base case \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en_{O(1)}=O(1)\u003c/code\u003e. Now we need to solve it, what we would like is for it to be exponential, because that means there's a lot of nodes in a height \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eh\u003c/code\u003e AVL tree. Look at the recurrence, doesn't it look like something very familiar to our developers when we first come to some of the first problem when we learn how to write code? Yes, the good old Fibonacci, it's almost Fibonacci except we have our additional \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003e+1\u003c/code\u003e in the recurrence. Well, that's actually good, because in particular, \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en_h\u003c/code\u003e is bigger than Fibonacci. So we have \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en_h\u003ef_h\u003c/code\u003e, if we add $1\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eat every single level then certianly we get something bigger than the base Fibonacci sequence. Now, hopefully you know Fibonacci is exponential. Let's bring something that is already prooved in order to help us reduce the work here, we know that\u003c/code\u003ef_h=\\frac{\\varphi^h}{\\sqrt{5}}\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003e(refs:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) the above method require rounding the result into the nearsest integer in order to give the exact result of the Fibonacci sequence, crazzy stuffs and obviously we don't need to know why that's true, just take it as fact. And conveniently\u003c/code\u003e\\varphi\u003e1\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003e, also we don't need to remember what \u003c/code\u003e\\varphi\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003e is(\u003c/code\u003e\\approx1.618\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003e), except it is bigger than 1. So we have an exponential bound, this is good news. What we really wanna know is how \u003c/code\u003eh\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003erelates to\u003c/code\u003en\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003e, which is just inverting the formula. So we have, on the other hand, \u003c/code\u003e\\frac{\\varphi^h}{\\sqrt{5}}\u0026#x3C;n_h\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003e, put on\u003c/code\u003elog_\\varphi\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eon both sides seems like a good thing to do. We get\u003c/code\u003eh - log_{\\varphi}\\sqrt{5}\u0026#x3C;log_{\\varphi}n\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003ewith\u003c/code\u003elog_{\\varphi} \\approx1.440\\times lgn\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003e, because after all, log base 2 is what computer scientists care about. So just to put it into perspective, now we claim that the height of an AVL tree is always less than $1.440\\times lgn\u003c/code\u003e and $1.44\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003e is a reasonable constant I believe, maybe we'd like $1\u003c/code\u003e, there are BSTs that achieve $1$ plus a very tiny thing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOkay so this is kinda of the hard way to argue that the height of an AVL tree is bounded by \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003eO(lgn)\u003c/code\u003e, there's a much easier way to analyze this recurrence though \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en_h=n_{h-2}+n_{h-1}+1\u003c/code\u003e.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis is the theorectical computer scientist way to solve this recurrence, we don't care about constants.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd so we say, aw, this is hard, I've got \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en_{h-1}\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en_{h-2}\u003c/code\u003e, aw, so asymetric, let's symmetrify. Could we make them both \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en_{h-1}\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en_{h-2}\u003c/code\u003e ?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en_{h-2}\u003c/code\u003e is the right way to go because we want to know \u003ccode class=\"language-math math-inline\"\u003en_h\u003c/code\u003e is greater than something in order to get a less than down here.

Hope you get some sense of the idea of AVL trees. If you looking for an example implementation of it, I've coded a version of an AVL tree for storing integers in Go you can take it as reference: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/mirageruler/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Implementations/blob/main/data_structures/tree/avl.go\"\u003ehttps://github.com/mirageruler/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Implementations/blob/main/data_structures/tree/avl.go\u003c/a\u003e.
