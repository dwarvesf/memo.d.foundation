# Reduced Build Log Verbosity

## Summary

Significantly reduced the verbosity of build logs during `pnpm next-build` by removing debug logging that was outputting massive amounts of contributor data during static site generation.

## What Changed

- **Build Logs**: Eliminated thousands of lines of verbose JSON output containing contributor profiles, GitHub information, and contribution statistics
- **Build Process**: Streamlined the static page generation logging to focus on essential information only
- **CI/CD Impact**: Reduced log noise that was making build monitoring and debugging more difficult

## Technical Details

- Removed debug `console.log` statement from the contributor index page that was outputting large contributor datasets
- This logging was executing during Next.js static site generation for all 3,228 pages
- The verbose output included detailed contributor profiles with GitHub URLs, avatars, company information, and contribution counts

## Benefits for Users

- **Cleaner Build Logs**: Much more readable build output without excessive JSON dumps
- **Faster Debugging**: Easier to identify actual build issues without noise
- **Improved Monitoring**: CI/CD systems can more efficiently parse and display build results
- **Reduced Storage**: Less disk space consumed by build logs

## Impact Assessment

- **Build Time**: Potential minor improvement due to reduced I/O overhead
- **Log Size**: Dramatic reduction in build log size (thousands of lines eliminated)
- **Developer Experience**: Significantly improved build log readability
- **Production Stability**: No functional changes to the application itself

## Context

This change is part of ongoing build time optimization efforts. While this addresses log verbosity, the underlying static page generation performance (3,228 pages comprising ~50% of build time) remains an area for future optimization.
