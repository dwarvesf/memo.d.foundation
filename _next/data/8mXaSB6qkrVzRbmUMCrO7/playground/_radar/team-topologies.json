An obsession with “feature delivery” ignores human-related and team-related dynamics inherent in modern software development, leading to disengagement from staff, especially when there are high cognitive loads.</p>\n<p>The Team Topologies pattern enables teams to address all these points by establishing a team-first approach to software delivery based on four fundamental team types, three patterns of interaction between teams, and ways of turning difficulties in delivery into signals for the self-steering organization.</p>\n<h2 id=\"output-goal\">Output Goal</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Re-structure organization to favor team-first thinking</li>\n<li>Setup enabling team to assist stream-align teams</li>\n<li>Create measurement metrics to evaluate collaboration effectiveness based on cognitive load, domain complexity, boundary size,…</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>(2022-08-28) - (Thanh) definition of Cognitive Load and why it’s relevant to engineering delivery - <a href=\"https://brain.d.foundation/Engineering/Management/Cognitive+load\">https://brain.d.foundation/Engineering/Management/Cognitive+load</a></li>\n<li>(2022-08-19) - (Thanh) definition of stream-aligned team - <a href=\"https://brain.d.foundation/Engineering/Management/Stream-aligned+team\">https://brain.d.foundation/Engineering/Management/Stream-aligned+team</a></li>\n<li>(2022-08-15) - (Thanh) definition of enabling team - <a href=\"https://github.com/dwarvesf/brain/pull/67\">https://github.com/dwarvesf/brain/pull/67</a></li>\n<li>(2022-08-14) - <strong>[Assess]</strong> (Thanh) start <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/462663954813157376/1008402647604265070\">Discord thread</a></li>\n<li>Submit Team Topologies note - <a href=\"https://github.com/dwarvesf/brain/pull/65\">https://github.com/dwarvesf/brain/pull/65</a></li>\n<li>Submit Team First Thinking note - <a href=\"https://github.com/dwarvesf/brain/pull/66\">https://github.com/dwarvesf/brain/pull/66</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"tags":null,"title":"Team Topologies","date":null,"description":null,"authors":null,"confidence":"Moderate","assign":"Thanh Pham","priority":null,"status":"Archived","quadrant":"Techniques","tag":"Management, Process"},"slug":["playground","_radar","team-topologies"],"backlinks":[],"tocItems":[{"id":"description","value":"Description","depth":2,"children":[]},{"id":"output-goal","value":"Output Goal","depth":2,"children":[]},{"id":"timeline","value":"Timeline","depth":2,"children":[]}],"metadata":{"created":null,"updated":null,"author":"","coAuthors":[],"tags":[],"folder":"playground/_radar","wordCount":190,"readingTime":"1m","characterCount":2137,"blocksCount":1},"isListPage":false},"__N_SSG":true}
