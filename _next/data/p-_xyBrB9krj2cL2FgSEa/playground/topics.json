This article delves into the challenges of traditional methods like complex UML diagrams and non-descriptive box-and-line drawings. We introduce the C4 model, a powerful framework that simplifies these challenges by using layered abstractions and visualizations. Explore how the model breaks down software architecture into comprehensible levels—Context, Container, Component, and Code—and offers guidelines on creating effective diagrams. Real-world examples illustrate the application of the C4 model, making it an invaluable tool for creating a shared understanding and ensuring clear, meaningful communication among all parties involved.","tags":["software-design","software-architecture","graphical-notation"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["jim"],"date":"Thu May 23 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/topics/architecture/c4-modelling.md","slugArray":["playground","topics","architecture","c4-modelling"]},{"content":"","title":"Case study: Write-heavy scalable and reliable inventory platform","short_title":"","description":"How Doordash designed a successful write-heavy scalable and reliable inventory platform","tags":["write-heavy","inventory-platform","scalability","reliability","doordash","low-latency","observability"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["cor3.co"],"date":"Tue Feb 28 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playground/topics/architecture/case-study-write-heavy-scalable-and-reliable-inventory-platform.md","slugArray":["playground","topics","architecture","case-study-write-heavy-scalable-and-reliable-inventory-platform"]},{"content":"","title":"Command Pattern","short_title":"","description":"Command is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object.
