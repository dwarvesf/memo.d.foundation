It’s a way to make your crypto work for you while you just chill. They started this on February 27, 2025 (yep, today!), and it’s got higher rewards than regular staking, but you gotta commit to keeping your funds in there for a bit. Pretty straightforward, lock it up, earn more, wait it out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/detail/ea4d4b4fa9f943fabd891c4d5836d230\">Source</a></p>\n<p><strong>Kredivo and Gajigesa Deal</strong></p>\n<p>Kredivo, a finance crew, teamed up with Gajigesa in a $12 million deal.
