There's no good to put people in a place where they can't create any impact. And we? We tend to fall for creating unnecessary job, which results in a waste of money and training resource. For the sake of that, don't hire because you feel to.\nUnless you're reaching out for help, hiring is the last thing you should keep in mind.\n\n![](assets/a-tips-of-hiring-dont_da9b94aa8e48a237d59aebc14e95e07d_md5.webp)\n\nBefore posting advertisements for open positions, make sure you understand every damn thing in the job description. Do it yourself. Understand the struggle. Automate the process. Optimize the method.\nThat's when you write the job description yourself. Knowing how the job operates gives you the proactivity to response whenever a question comes up. And most importantly, you have an actual expectation for them to meet, not some crap they can learn online.\n\nWe do believe in hard working. In fact, we urge the team to discover their limit in any possible way. But for the love of God, don't misunderstand it with the state of burying your head in the sand. It trims off the quality, and things end up worse than they should have been just because we try to reach things that are way over our head.

A good plan needs lots of details, they said. But in real life, where nothing is certain and is filled with sudden surprises, a good plan should prioritize its flexibility and simplicity.\n\nStart with the main goals of the week, then expand on the actual required actions to achieve those desired goals. Always remember to add in extra 2 hours of standby in between early morning and noon to have space for the urgent work. In those days when those free 2 hours were not needed, use it to review the past works or a quick investment time to catch up with the progress of the fast-pace tech world.\n\nLastly, being neat always help in many cases. It helps one to maintain the transparency in the work and can ensure that they will not miss out on anything.\n\n### Penetration\nHow can we acquire more clients? How can we connect to our clients?\n\nCommunication is an art. Every kind of art requires skills and sensitivity to master. In order to connect to the clients, one needs to knows about the clients' feelings. This takes careful sensitivity and awareness.\n\nAnd then one will learn that communication requires both parties to participate. Sometimes you can keep sending the signals and messages and will not receive a concrete answer. In those cases, how can you really connect with them? Simple. Find the right contact point. Sometimes communication has to start indirectly. In cases, you have to go through the engineers, whom always have to talk to someone on the client's side. Working from an indirect source and go all the way to where you want to be.\n\nFor the projects that really cannot have an established line of communication, one will need to consider stop having a one-direction relationship. It is not healthy and respectable. No one will ever need to maintain such relationship that is unhealthy and unequal.\n\nHow can we acquire more clients? Once we can secure to have a good interaction with 1 client, then we will have more good relationships with other clients. Then we really do not need to do much, truly. Because a flower will bloom on its own when it is ready, and its scent will naturally attract many attentions, naturally. In a world when everything is good, then one should not have such worries. What makes us fall into the negativity is our fear of the unknown.\n\nTruly, why would one should feel scare of the uncertainty?\n\n### Retention\nGood service quality, fast response, keep an up-close-and-personal communication line had supported Dwarves Foundation to ensure the satisfaction of its clients. Of course, in order to acquire this achievement, the Account Manager will need to have a sharp “people” sense to understand the thinking and working style of its clients, and to know when we need to take a few step back, to move much further forward.\n\n### Management\nKnow your team members and know the company goals very well.\n\nKnow when to make a tough decision.\n\nKnow when your team members need to step up in the game.\n\nKnow how to identify when the client is being unreasonable.\n\nKnow how to let go of the ego, and embrace the present.\n\n### Building Relationships\nOne way to impress a client is firstly yielding to their paths first. Once they see that you are (kind of) on their sides, they will have more trust in you. Then they will become more open with you.\n\nAnd then the rest is basically in your hands to control.\n\nIn order to build a good relationship, one must remember to control the ego. In this case, let our clients to be consumed by their own egos and feelings. Restraint from jumping into the swirling mess. Be calm.\n\nOnce they have fully absorbed all of their angers, you just need to step in with a simple statement \"I understand your feelings. Let me help you solve this issue. I am capable of handling this issue.\"\n\nAfter all, in order to become a good Account Manager, one of the most important aspects is knowing how to balance between the toughness and softness. Softness will help you to build a longer-lasting relationships with clients, with the engineers. Toughness will help you to draw the borderlines for the clients, to let them know where they should not cross and what they should have done. At the same time, that toughness will also be the wake-up call for others to sharpen up themselves. Everybody will need a push from somebody to move on forward.\n","title":"Account","short_title":"","description":"","tags":["operation","management"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao","duy"],"date":"Wed Mar 25 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playbook/operations/account.md","slugArray":["playbook","operations","account"]},{"content":"\nBeing in a remote team is dope. Manage your own stuff, remove the time and cost of commuting, select your work ambiance, and got equipped with all types of supporting tools.\n\nBasecamp, for example.\n\nOur path with Basecamp didn't cross by accident. Years ago, we embarked on the Slack community and had it applied for internal communication. And project management on another tool, where documents & files are in G-suite. Every day is a short strip from one place to another. Then get back. Then do it again tomorrow.\n\n![](assets/adjust-the-way-we-work-in-basecamp-style_658f6b0263106796290e37aa78015232_md5.webp)\n\nAs much as we enjoyed the fast replies and high-engaging interaction amongst the member, it's challenging to focus on the work. Every smallest message can become a team gossip/ discussion, not to mention the biggest distracting part - memes. That shit is unstoppable.\n\nInevitably, we need a work-concentrated solution for team engagement. It must contain every function to manage or organize projects. A place for data storage. A safe zone for team communication. The interface must be formal enough not to cause distraction, yet still casual for a Dwarves to drop his inspiration of the day.\n\nAnd that's when we found Basecamp.\n\nMoving the whole theme to Basecamp wasn't easy, especially when we have gotten used to the small daily talks. At first, there wasn't much conversation transpire in Basecamp. We only touch it for project briefing and note down the to-do list. As time goes by, we're getting closer to the part where Basecamp acts as a great supporter of team communication & project development. Basically, this is how we organize things, in one place.\n\n## Places\n### Woodlands/ HQ\nFor company wide-announcement. This keeps the message board of company updates, team chatting & resources everyone needs to know.\n\n### Teams\nFor team activities, this is customized due to the team's demand. That also includes the schedule for team meetings, workshop/ topics discussion & team research.\n\n### Projects\nFor project details and people in charge. By categorizing the projects, we instantly know how many projects we're participating in, and the backlog for each one. Each project comes with a separated campfire, to sure you're discussing the right thing, at the right place.\n\n## Into Details\n### Automatic Check-Ins\nRight, the thing that keeps Basecamp interesting. Automatic Check-Ins is the common name we use for the scheduled questions. In fact, there are several ones. Here are some active ones.\n\n* What's something you recently learned or discovered? Show and tell!\n* Seen any good movies lately?\n* Seen anything recently that others on the team would find interesting?\n\nBeside, another question might come with every project/team, which is **'What did you work on today?'**\n\nThis aims to log the accomplishment of the day, or as I have mentioned in [Daily Check-Ins](https://dwarves.foundation/memo/daily-check-ins), a subtle cry for help. The answer should not conform to any format, but it needs a sense of progress so we'll know where it's heading to.\n\n### Todos\nNeedless to say what this is about, I guess I'll just drop the necessary input.\n* **Title**: A concise brief of the task\n* **Assign to**: Name of person in charge (PIC)\n* **When done, notify**: If it's a self-task, leave it blank. If it needs approval, tag the line manager or a PIC\n* **Due on**: Deadline of the task\n* **Notes**: Detailed description, or material attachment\n\n### Schedule\nWe use this for time-reserved activities.\n\n* Daily Team/ Project meeting\n* Webinar/ Topic Discussion\n* Sprint planning/ Retrospective\n\n#### Link it with Google Calendar/ Apple Calendar\nLink Basecamp Schedule with Google/Apple Calendar helps us track the meeting easier from a broader view, combining our personal schedules & team schedules to make sure it won't get overlapped.\n\n### Message Board\nFor Woodland, it might be a company updates/ policy, or just some cool things we want the team to know or ask for their opinion.\nFor Team & Project, it's a place for topic research output, learning resource, project briefing, or meeting notes.\n\nWhen something is brought to the Message Board, it's official and it includes the key message. Not all of us will hang around to scrutinize the mess, the best approach is to bullet the right point on top, then dive in the details later. But if it's not a big deal, we throw it in Campfire.\n\n### Docs & Files\nThe storage for team document assets forwarded email or the helpful ebooks. At first, it was a mess since we kept piling up the files in no order. Then we started to create folders and put things where it belongs.\n\nDocs & Files can also be uploaded through a link from Google Drive, Dropbox or any Cloud storage. So frankly we didn't need to migrate the whole knowledge hub, we just figure a way to sync the two together.\n\n### Jump Quickly\nWhen you've had enough with the scrolling, a shortcut is a savior. Basecamp takes you to the place you need using **Ctrl+J**. Latest message board, team, projects, pings. Anything.\n\n## Furthermore\nBasecamp is formal enough to keep people concentrated on what they do, but still it gives them the chance to be creative.\n\n![](assets/adjust-the-way-we-work-in-basecamp-style_f6faf06ec700b2002c00cd15aa3ea707_md5.webp)\n\nAnother thing that drives us toward is how Basecamp makes things transparent. The 'Activity' tab reveals everything we need to know, whenever we need it. That somehow helps us focus on what matters, and reduce the risk of FOMO.\n\nWe encourage the Dwarves to bring project/team discussion out to the Campfire, or drop their comment in the thread below every Message Board. Private pings happen sometimes, but not as much as previously. Keep conversations public helps create engaging participation, builds culture, and reduces the need for one-on-one conversations as you feel more obligated to bring something to the table.\n","title":"Adjust The Way We Work In Basecamp Style","short_title":"","description":"Our path with Basecamp didn't cross by accident.

In a recent post I wrote, titled \"[Inner Circle](/db6561d944f4443789dfef3f12a87496)\", I expounded on the importance of contribution and value in relation to a person's work or performance. However, there is another key aspect to this topic that must be taken into consideration. One of the most effective ways to determine how well a person is performing is by asking the question, \"**Are you helping?**\" Through evaluating the output of an individual's work, we can gain a clear understanding of how much value they are providing and how well they are performing.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that salary and job title are not the only indicators of an employee's value. Salary is merely a social contract that pre-agrees on how much a person will be paid based on the value they produce. A job title, on the other hand, defines the scope of a person's work. When an individual is not producing the agreed upon value, they may be viewed negatively and conflicts may arise in the workplace. In such cases, it is vital to remember that the true measure of a person's worth is their ability to help and contribute to the success of the organization or team.\n\nAnother significant aspect to consider is that when an individual is not performing up to expectations, they may be deemed **overpaid**. This can lead to increased expectations from colleagues and managers, as well as negative evaluations during performance reviews. Therefore, it is vital to understand that producing value is the key to success in any organization and that salary and job title should not be the only factors considered when evaluating an employee's worth and performance.\n\nIn conclusion, organizations must recognize that the value and performance of employees is crucial for their success. Asking the question \"**Are you helping?**\" can provide valuable insight into the worth and performance of employees. Additionally, it is essential for organizations to understand that salary and job title should not be the only factors considered when evaluating an employee's value. The ability to help and contribute to the success of the organization is the true measure of an employee's worth.\n\nAre you helping?\n\n![](assets/are-you-helping_ed16be5f935ca5845b3a42984cdee76a_md5.webp)\n","title":"Are You Helping","short_title":"","description":"In a recent post I wrote \"Inner Circle\", I expounded on the importance of contribution and value in relation to a person's work or performance.","tags":["performance","operations","hiring"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":[],"date":"Tue Jan 31 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playbook/operations/are-you-helping.md","slugArray":["playbook","operations","are-you-helping"]},{"content":"\nJust to be clear, this term has nothing to compare with the emotional crisis you go through daily - stress. No, burn-out isn't stress.\n\nIt describes the state of physical and emotional exhaustion. Burnout reduces and sucks out your productivity. As it develops, it beats every single reason that once was your working motto. The interest, the creativity and motivation gets faded away. Your job might be done, but you no longer feel satisfied. You have nothing more to give, or break the boundaries. You fed up of doing monotonous work with same tools. You stuck in a place where there is only one question lingers: What the heck am I doing here?\n\nFellas, welcome to the burnout station.\n\n![](assets/avoid-burn-out_10437bf97d35a54a0ca1b65fc00984b1_md5.webp)\n\nA family dinner or weekend getaway may soften the mood, burnout, on the other hand, is a process as its negatives reach to every aspects, all at once. Work, family, passion, friends, relationship. If stress is about being stacked up with too much work at the same time, burnout is when nothing feels enough. It was not a result from job demands, it's a notion that nothing you do brings impact, your idea wasn't listened, and the fact that you live through a day in that place was a freaking waste of time.\n\nSo what is the best cure for burnout? Try harder? No shit. Even machines crash when you have them worked at 100% effectiveness every day.\n\nAddress the changes, even the tiniest. Those early symptoms are red flags that you'll be thankful for noticing that soon. Feeling drained from a project? Talk to a coworker, seek for some help, adjust your schedule, confess to your boss how you feel or simply just shut your laptop and go grab a junk food. **Just Do Something**.\n\nThis is where the term work-life balance comes in. It's not merely some remote days out of the week, it means making time for your own interest. Write, read, paint, travel. Things that boost your mood and remind you that life isn't just about sacrificing for work. Have your limit demarcated and take the ownership of your actions.\n\nBurnout happens like burning the candle at both ends. But you get to select what time to pull the plug and replace with a new one.\n","title":"Avoid Burn Out","short_title":"","description":"Burnout happens like burning the candle at both ends.

You're only paid that much to do that much\n2. We only pay you that much if you can do only that much\n\nIt's the scenario that people measure and expect their effort should be traded into paychecks. Employers issue fixed rates for labors, while employees refuse to do things that are not in the job description. It gradually forms a mindset where people decide to work \"enough\" to get paid and miss out on the chance to discover their self-limitation.\n\n## Give and Take\nWe develop a tendency to think outside the box. It's a part of our hiring culture. We'd want to see if what we produce matters rather than asking for benefits before rolling up the sleeves. At the end of the day, the result is all we care about.\n\nPay the upfront cost, take a longer landsight, and the math will add up in the end. Tweaking the plan with long-term thinking.\n\n## Fail. Explore. Grow\nWe want to make impacts or influence people in some ways. That doesn't happen if we wait for the right moment because there isn't. Taking the shot means opening the door to mistakes and failures, and that's a good thing. We learn from them.\n\nOnce the urge to outgrow ourselves knocks on the door, sitting idly isn't an option. There are always more rooms to explore if we have exceeded the current role. Making a career at our place takes more than the scope of work and performance review. We long for people to stick with us in the long term, and there's only one way to get there: Become better not only at the role but also as a team.\n\n![](assets/beyond-the-title_e4451267b269ff558c5138fc551830b1_md5.webp)\n\n## Become Better\nIt performs in many aspects, but these two receive a big encouragement.\n\n### As a role\nAn organization with people collaborating effectively is more valuable than having many top-notch individuals who refuse to work with each other. Be willing to support if that benefits the team's mutual goal. Raise issues, give feedback and communicate with constructive intention. Be a team player. Be someone that people can count on.\n\n### As a team\nWe explore and share. No matter if the work happens with ourselves or it's a team thing, knowledge is meant for transfer. Every little detail makes the big picture more worthy of looking at. We build and fix along the way. We leave things better than when we found them.\n\n## The Title Matters\nOf course, it does. But titles have nothing much to do with the day-to-day work routine. In fact, it raises the responsible bar. \n\nTitles hands you the accountability for your decision. You're in charge of the success and the failure, the orders and the messes. It's where your move starts to affect others, and it forces you to act right. Where your voice influences and spreads the common belief to the subordinates. It shows that you've gone far from where you begin, and you're capable of going further.\n\nWith us, fancy titles exist when the contribution generates a positive impact. We also believe in how great leaders create other leaders, and we cherish every effort to make room for people to go beyond their titles.","title":"Beyond The Title","short_title":"","description":"We want to make impacts or influence people in some ways.

Sometimes, it is too hard to focus and it affect our life quality a lot.\n\nSo there are couple things that we can do to avoid this problem.\n\n### Spend time to be alone everyday\nIt can be 1–2 hours and you can truly focus on what ready matter. I spend a lot of time alone, maybe a long walk, maybe reading time, maybe exercising time, but those times bring a lot of new & better ideas to solve other problems.\n\n### Remove background noise\nFor not urgent things, I always want to **use asynchronous communications, like text or email**, because interruption wastes us a lot of time. I always prefer scheduled meeting time than just random chat. I block facebook and most noise sites on my phones. Most of the things are just noise, focus on what matters actually make a huge difference in results, information is no exception.\n\n### Have time just doing nothing\nDoing nothing means actually doing nothing, watching a movie is not doing nothing. It’s easy to be trapped in to the busy world, for me, unproductive busy is worse than doing nothing. Sometimes, doing nothing is the best thing you can do.\n\n### Have very fresh & slow mornings\nWe should not rush through the morning because that’s the most productive & creative time. Morning is the time to complete that hardest tasks. It can make or break your day, morning is the time for you to do the most meaningful work before everything else.\n\n### Go with the [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29)\nYou know that there are times you are really at the flow and you should repeat that by different methods. One of my favorite ways is repeating a favorite song over and over again while working something else. Time just passes by and I really deep dive into what I’m doing and get extreme productive.\n\nIn conclusion, information disorder can be an unknown unknown problem for a lot of people, it means you are not aware of about that problem, and you do not know that you have that problem.

Many successes and disasters start with recruiting. Recruiting is the most important job for any real leader in the company.\n\nThe second step is all about the right placement of the stars in your constellation. No matter what bullshit motivational book you may have read, people do not change. Yes, people do evolve, and yes, those not capable of evolution should never become a part of your team, but for Pete’s sake, do not confuse skill evolution with personality change. **Attempts to change who a person is don’t work in dating** (**ever heard of the term “project boyfriend”?**) **or in the workplace**.\n\nThe third step is to minimize “toxicity” and take advantage of learning from your inevitable failures. An agile and derivative methodology excels at this. Divide and conquer, but don’t forget to learn. Incremental improvement and fast learning methodologies are fantastic for every functional area of the business (yes, even for boring bookkeeping). When properly practiced, they will keep you from squandering resources on dead-end projects, prevent you from making large stumbles, and lead to addictive progress.\n","title":"Building A Solid High Performing Team","short_title":"","description":"Sustainable growth companies are built by teams of shining constellations rather than just several bright stars.

phase\n- New features/change requests will be put into Icebox/Backlog, estimated, and planned for future Sprints\n- Bugs can be added to the current Sprint depends on priority, complexity, and available points of the Sprint\n- The intention of every Sprint is “Potentially Shippable” Software, things can go wrong and features might get pushed to the next Sprint\n- Every 2 weeks, the Team Lead, Product Manager/Project Manager, and Account Manager will have a quick 15 minutes meeting to review the work progress and resolve any conflicts (if any)\n\n### Design <> Development\n- The design team should at least provide:\n    - Color palette (all that are used throughout the UI)\n    - Heading / Font size should be defined by scale (similar to [Tailwind's](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size/#usage))\n    - Base components (.eg headings, button variants, and states,...)\n- A new design version is expected to be available and reviewed **by the development team** before the Sprint started\n\n### Backend <> Frontend\n- Pre-requisite:\n    - API versioning & documentation (.eg Swagger)\n    - Dedicated environments for Development / Staging / Production\n- Backend should enable CORS on either API gateway or at the application level\n- Both sides should agree on the same glossary/naming conventions / data schema, preferably within the first Sprint\n\n### Quality Assurance <> Development\n- Bugs/issues raised should include:\n    - Steps to reproduce, behaviorally described from application's entry to bug encounter\n    - Affected platform, version, feature, language (if applicable)\n    - Severity level\n- For Frontend (web), each feature's Pull Request will have a dedicated environment for testing. Use it to run feature tests before it got merged\n\n## Release\n- We release the end of each Sprint (on Sprint wrap-up day - the day before the Retrospective meeting)\n- Hotfix releases are ad-hoc\n- What's included in a release:\n    - Semantic version tagging\n    - release notes, changelogs, known issues\n    - release's artifacts\n- Backend and Frontend (or each micro-service in the system) will be released individually based on the Semantic version\n\n## Customer feedback\nWe received and response to feedback via direct message, email, or video calls. Specific feedback should be directed to specific PIC in a project team:\n\n- Implementation/Development: Team Lead, Project Lead\n- Sprint result: Project Lead, Account Manager\n- Project progress: Project Lead, Account Manager\n- Pricing/Billing: Account Manager\n- Communication issues: Project Lead\n\n## Issues management\nWe promise to respond and resolve in a timely fashion when problems arise, depends on priority & severity.\n\nAfter issues were resolved, we will conduct an issue investigation and provide preventive measures (if applicable).\n\nThere are **4 levels** of severity:\n\n### Critical: 4\nThe production system is down or a major function is unusable and there is no acceptable alternative method to achieve the required results. Support in such emergency issues is available via our hotline.\n\n- Contact channel: hotline\n- Response time: within 10 minutes\n- Promised resolve time: less than 30 minutes\n\n### Major: 3\nMajor features of the product are failed and/or performance issues impacting the normal functioning of multiple users.\n\n- Contact channel: email, primarily communication channel\n- Response time: within 30 minutes\n- Promised resolve time: from 2 to 5 hours\n\n### Moderate: 2\nModerate loss of application functionality or performance degradation.

The total invoice will base on the deployed resources, whether the project type is Fixed-price or Time & Materials (T&M). This method will enable a constant monthly cost, allows the Accountant from both parties to control the project costs & budgets more efficiently, as well as helping the Project Manager to foresee and eliminate any arising miscellaneous fees.\n\nOur rates are always recorded in **NET** amount, excluded from all types of taxes, bank fees, and account-related fees.\n\nOur invoice will contain the necessary information for the Client to proceed with the internal approval and wiring requirements:\n\n- Bank information\n- Invoice description\n- Invoice details\n\nThe Client will have **10** **(Ten) business days** to complete these invoices. If the Client needs to extend the payment deadline, the Client is required to submit a written request to Dwarves Foundation within *72 hours* after the invoice date. A new deadline then will be decided and agreed by both parties, before it can be implemented officially.\n\nOur Accountant and Account Manager will send out reminders to the Clients who may have forgotten about the outstanding invoices. If any Client failed to complete the payment on time and failed to submit a request for an extended payment deadline to Dwarves Foundation, we will add a *10% interest rate/month* to the outstanding invoice(s).\n\n## Project Responsibility Scope\nTo avoid us as a project team from stepping on each other's foot and to ensure a healthy relationship for the team and Client.\n\n**Team lead**\n- Main PIC of the offshore development team\n- Define technical stacks (together with the Client's team, if applicable)\n- Main PIC of project's infrastructure (if applicable, there are cases where infrastructure is managed/provided by Client's team)\n- Daily/bi-weekly/weekly progress sync-up and report to Client\n- Receive, discuss and make plans for project milestones\n- Run the development Sprint with offshore team and Client\n\n**Account Manager**\n- Receive Client's direct feedback\n- Make improvement plans for the offshore team from provided feedback\n- Maintaining the relationship between both sides\n- Ensuring development time, workforce and workload maps accurately to the Client's budget\n\n**Project Manager?**\n- Designing and applying appropriate project management standards\n- Managing the production of the required deliverables, and project administration\n- Adopting any delegation and use of project assurance roles within agreed reporting structures\n- Managing project risks, including the development of contingency plans.\nliaison with program management (if the project is part of a program) and related projects to ensure that work is neither overlooked nor duplicated.\n- Monitoring overall progress and use of resources, initiating corrective action where necessary\napplying change control and configuration management processes.\n- Reporting through agreed lines on project progress through highlight reports and end-stage assessments.\n- Liaison with appointed project assurance representatives to assure the overall direction and integrity of the project.\n- Maintaining an awareness of potential interdependencies with other projects and their impact\nadopting and applying appropriate technical and quality strategies and standards\n- Identifying and obtaining support and advice required for the management, planning and control of the project.\n- Conducting a project evaluation review to assess how well the project was managed\npreparing any follow-on action recommendations","title":"Collaboration Guidelines","short_title":"","description":"Guidelines for project collaboration between Dwarves and our Clients.","tags":["operations","project"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["hnh"],"date":"Wed Jan 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playbook/operations/collaboration-guidelines.md","slugArray":["playbook","operations","collaboration-guidelines"]},{"content":"\n## Compliance Checklist\nCompliance master list is stored [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16HtA3skVpEdDpuJ9UEkPb5Ae_SK6IiJ5Czfl_94XqN4/edit#gid=449337167).\n\n## Compliance execution\nCompliance check will be done in the monthly basis:\n\n- Each month compliance team will pick 30% projects to execute compliance checklist.\n- The master compliance checklist will be cloned to another file and name as df-compliance-<field-where-executed>-<yyyy><mm>.

If the delegatee has no prior experience, they can benefit from a bit of best practices, sources of additional information, or personal tricks of the trade.\n\n### It won't be Perfect\nAdmit it, nothing can be. Once you've decided to ask for help, understand that it's hard to fully reach the expectation you've envisioned earlier. Of course, it would be groundbreaking if they made it (and believe me, this is rare), but be prepared that things may not turn out good *enough*. And guess what, that's fine. It's better to be done than to be perfect.\n\nBeing a leader sometimes feels like carrying the heaviest burden. Somewhere along the way, most important decisions and actions get delayed because we are too busy considering the risk.\n\n### DoD, Feedback and Communication\nCommunication is a part of delegating. Communicate any and all pitfalls, points of caution, and other negatives that may affect the delegated work. Define an expectation. Set a deadline. Give them the same point of view before starting on the job. Instruct them along the way and remind them to come with questions at any time. Assist and provide feedback until the job is done, flawlessly. Work doesn't run on assumption. State things clear and verify if needed. Rework is a nightmare, and no one wants that.\n\n### Be anything but a Control Freak\nMicromanaging is not delegating. Having them do the job and still checking up on it 3 times a day doesn't make anyone's life easier.\nPeople are programmed to function differently from one to another, and so is their way to tackle a problem. Empowering with authority, get out of the way and let them surprise you.\n\n### Work, not Responsibility\nDelegating work does not absolve you of responsibility. It's an attempt to wrap up the job. That comes under the form of tasks & to-dos, where they help clean up the work you struggling with or having bottleneck decision.\n\nIn the case of a failure, the blame is all yours. Investors will go after the CEO, even if an intern made the mistake that hurts the company.\n\nEverything must be well-transferred and carefully considered before trusting someone with delegated work. That includes the competency and effort towards the work itself. Delegated work also requires the person's willingness to invest in personal development. It is vital to have those people around if you're planning on building a team to drive for constant movement.\n\nDelegation can sometimes be seen as a training task or a challenge for the assignee to overcome. In this way, the delegator will have more compassion than expectation toward the assignee, and allows both of them to collaborate with each other better.\n","title":"Delegation And Believe It Will Work","short_title":"","description":"We can't always make things (or everything) on our own.

If you're attending a meeting, you are responsible for showing up on time.\n\n**Meetings happen in regular hours**\nAll team members should make themselves available for face-to-face meetings between 10:30am - 1:00p, as long as they are scheduled at least 24 hours in advance. If a meeting needs to happen outside of these hours, the meeting organizer should scheduled it a week in advance.\n\n**Meetings should have a video option**\nIf you're hosting a meeting with a remote worker invited, it's your responsibility to provide a video link before the meeting starts for them to join.\n\nIf you're attending a meeting remotely, you should join the video call before a meeting starts. It's your responsibility to ensure this is possible ,  this means being in a quiet place with a fast internet connection before the meeting starts. Calling into a meeting via phone or from a public place is unacceptable.\n\nFor some meetings, voice calls will be sufficient - this decision is up to the meeting organizer when they create the meeting.\n\n**Prerequisites for successful meetings**\nThe following things are pre-requisites for successful group work:\n\n* A fast, reliable internet connection. Remote employees should make all efforts to mitigate video call lag.\n* A quiet place to take meetings\n\nIf you're planning to work with another person on the team (i.e. for a meeting during meeting hours or to pair program), you should make sure these are available.\n\nInspired by [Clef]().\n","title":"Effective Meeting","short_title":"","description":"","tags":["remote","meeting"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":[],"date":"Sun Jan 10 2016 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playbook/operations/effective-meeting.md","slugArray":["playbook","operations","effective-meeting"]},{"content":"\n**Title:** Dwarves Foundation - Assignment Invitation\n\n**Body**\n\nHi [**name**]\n\nCongratulations on reaching the second round for [**position**] position.\n\nTo better match your potential with our role, we would like you to complete a small exercise at [**link**].

I mean, I've never walked in this shoe before. Wth is a product person? I wondered. And I started digging. Here it is, \"Making sure your product/ thing shipped out flawlessly.\" A perfectionist mindset.\n\nSounds a bit crazy, yet a lil intrigued. Intrigued enough to leave me with some concepts.\n\n## No one wants a poor product\nAnd no one wants to work with people who keep making poor products. We, indeed, all want to use things in their best states. So why bear being someone who creates a poor one? That just doesn't make any sense.\n\n## Exceed the Expectation\nCan't stand the idea of using low standard things? Train yourself with the habit of upgrading. Every time you look back on what you've worked on, there should be something to optimize. At least that's how I feel whenever I look back on my writings. I can finish it in pride, then look at it 3 weeks later and feel like it's full of crap. Sometimes it doesn't take me up to 3 weeks. Sometimes it's tomorrow.\n\n## Notice the little things\nLittle things count. They really do. Pay attention to your work, how you approach, how you solve or react to it. You eventually find it's the completion of those details that fulfills the big picture.\n\nPolishing your work tells the most about your work ethic. Remember when they say: \"How you treat yourself is how you teach people to treat you\"? The same thing happens with products.\n\n## Extra mile >< Overwork\nExtra mile has nothing to do with overwork. Here's a fact. You can only go the extra mile with what you truly want. That's how you lift it to a higher level. That's how you go 'extra.' Taking pride in what you do makes it hard to fail in the long run.\n\nAfter all, doing one thing ideally is way better than ten things half-ass.\n","title":"Go The Extra Mile","short_title":"","description":"A couple days ago, I was asked if I were ever a product person, what would I do to make the best out of it.

Hiring means we failed to execute and need help\n2. Startup employee effectiveness follows a power law\n3. False Positives are ok, False Negatives are not\n4. Culture is defined by who we hire\n5. The best thing you can do for employees ,  a perk better than foosball or free sushi ,  is hire only “A” players to work alongside them. Excellent colleagues trump everything else\n\n## Heuristics\n\n* Hire for Strength vs Lack of Weakness\n* Hire for Trajectory vs Experience\n* Hire Doers vs Tellers\n* Hire Learners vs Experts\n* Hire Different vs Similar\n* Always pass on ego\n\n**Hire for Attitude Rather than Skill**\nTeaching skills is a snap compared with doing attitude transplants. When looking to hire the right candidate), among the qualities you'll want most is a fierce sense of optimism.\n\n**Look for Renegades**\nOne of the best interview strategies is to ask when the person has been in trouble. The obedient employee will be of limited use to you in this change-up environment.\n\n**Hold out for Results**\nNever hire someone with good potential but questionable habits, thinking you can change him or her. As in choosing mates, what you see now is what you get forever.\n\n**Go for a Sense of Humor**\nThe potential hire who can't laugh easily, particularly at themself, is going to be a very dull and probably rigid employee.\n\n**Fill in the Blanks**\nLook carefully at the aggregate strengths and skill gaps of your teams in various work units, and go for the qualities and styles that are missing.\n\n**Stock the Bullpen**\nKeep an eye out for prospects before the need arises. Don't wait until a vacancy occurs. Keep a pool of potential employees under the watchful eye of somebody who's responsible for hiring. Evaluate your recruiting team in terms of how well they keep the bullpen ready. And tell them never to turn away an interesting candidate with the line, \"We don't have any positions open right now.\"\n\n**Look for intellectual horsepower and curiosity**\nIs a candidate capable of getting the big picture? Are they a good communicator? Do they have cross-functional skills and interests?\n\nThese are some of the best markers of intellectual horsepower and potential, going beyond her current skillset and become a leader in your organization. You should be hiring for growth.\n\nDon't just evaluate where candidates are, but where they’re going (and how fast)\nWell, human interaction is the best way to grade potential, so the interview is a great setting to evaluate curiosity and communication skills.\n\n**Push Harder for Diversity**\nMake certain you're spreading your net wide enough to find those high-potential, but different, fish who generally don't swim in the streams near you. Ask your HR group what contacts and periodicals they're using to interest potential hires. \"We don't know where to find people different from us\" is a costly excuse.\n\n## Protecting vs. Growing Culture\n\nFor many companies, hiring means selecting people who fit the existing culture and keeping out those who don’t. Hiring is gatekeeping.\n\nOur culture is dynamic. It should expand like our business. We welcome its change. Just like we want people to contribute new skills and ideas, we want people to contribute new culture. Hiring culture-fitters does not make our culture better.\nHire culture-contributors who will make our culture better.\n\n![](assets/hiring-approach_446cd358745fe9024a7304905bb0572a_md5.webp)\n\n## Culture add, not culture fit\n\nCulture fit is a variable that has become increasingly important in the hiring process. Companies aren't just looking for candidates with the right skills - they want someone that matches their company DNA.\n\nIt's easy to fall into the trap of hiring people like everyone else in your company as a default. Adding people like you can create a \"me-too\" culture, not typically an environment where ideas and innovation flourish.\n\nInstead, look for people that add to your culture. Hiring candidates that bring something different to the table gives you a diverse workforce that can approach business problems from different directions instead of focusing on what a candidate lacks\n\n**Listen**\nRule one with how to interview: Most interviewers talk way too much. When a candidate finally gets to you, listen for the \"story line\" of his or her life, at home and at work. It's been said that being a leader is like practicing psychiatry without a license. That may be more true in hiring than in any other part of the job.\n\n**Don't get desperate**\nIn certain situations, this can lead to hiring decisions being made around urgency, not quality. A hiring manager just needs *someone*, they don't care who. Building a great team means not compromising on your hiring bar.\n\nAlign you around the goal of hiring the right person, not just hiring quickly. Think about the long-term impact of hiring the wrong person. We're building a company for the long term, we need the best people.\n\n**Always be recruiting**\nCandidates came from everywhere, from professional conferences, from the sidelines of a kids’ soccer game, from conversations on airplanes. But certain fundamentals were strictly enforced. The interview and hiring process gives a powerful first impression about how your company operates, for good or bad\n\n## Offering\n\n* If a candidate is the right fit, move quickly\n* Before you make an offer, make sure you know exactly what the offer package will look like and don’t be vague about it\n* If the candidate turns you down, remain friendly and maintain a relationship. They might change their minds in the future.\n","title":"Hiring Approach","short_title":"","description":"Hire people who tell us what to do, not the other way around.","tags":["people","operations","hiring"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao","duy","giangthan"],"date":"Tue Jun 26 2018 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playbook/operations/hiring-approach.md","slugArray":["playbook","operations","hiring-approach"]},{"content":"\nOperations is a very sensitive area of the company, so be very picky. A great ops person can dramatically improve the way your company works and make your life a lot easier.\n\n**Operations is operations, no matter the industry**\n\nOperations problems are almost the same everywhere (in ultra-specialized and regulated industries we just surround ourselves with specialists and attorneys). Industry experience is helpful, but not as much as you think.\n\n**A good operations leader will be a specialist in being the connector and arbiter between functional areas**.\n\n*Hands-on* experience in the areas of IT, HR, accounting, recruiting, infrastructure, marketing, sales, etc. is very important. Lack of it handicaps.\n\n**An operations leader should have no qualms about getting his/her hands dirty**\n\nNo white gloves here! But at the same time they should have very good judgment when to give someone opportunity to struggle a bit, so they learn.\n\n**Real operations people will have backup plans for backup plans**\n\nThis is how our heads work ALL the time (at work and home). You will not find us bungee jumping or skydiving because there is only one backup in case of failure.\n\n**Those fearing dirt and scars have no place in operations**.\n\nOperations people should be the Secret Service of the company. Not only are we most instrumental in sustainable growth of the company, but we also take a lot of “bullets” and “cuts”. We are like an adult or a parent in the company – constantly removing impediments, cleaning up the messes, leading discipline, and taking the fall for others. If the operations team works well, everything runs smoothly and very few have full comprehension of the massive load we have on our shoulders.\n\n**Instead of “faking it”, a good operations person will pick up the phone and ask for advice from experts**.\n\nA large contact list of suppliers, vendors, and specialists is essential for our everyday success.\n\n**We should be able to speak the “language” of every professional on the team.**\n\nEarning credibility with everyone in the organization is extremely important to the success of the person in this position. It is hard! No, it is actually extremely hard. It is the hardest thing in this list and perfection here is almost impossible.

Something that polishes the importance of human to the company. Something that emphasizes how HR should do their best to nurture the talents.\n\nBut here's the funny thing. Most of those talks drive the audience back to tips. How to make people happy. How to keep them engaged. How to motivate. That's the point. Too many '*how-tos*'.\n\nAnd that usually the part when I say \"Ok, we're done here.\"\n\nCut the crap. Happiness is fake. People matter when they believe in what they create. That's how we keep them around, by letting them know their real value.\n\n## The Individual Contribution\nScanning through the random answers of Automatic Check-Ins is quite fun sometimes. Or even in the announced message for a product or a checked-off milestone. It's easier to know people's attempt through the way they talk about their work, and the pride they embed in the message.\n\nDon't finish a product story without a special thank to the product creator.\n\n## Unconventional\nIt doesn't take an engineering background to work in software industry. Been there, done that.\n\nLet's take a look at our hiring. Not all developers come from a technology-based background; not all designers graduated from the art university. And me? Two years ago, my head went against the wall to finish a degree in International Business.\n\nThe culture we are pursuing is the combination between the unconventional spirit and the will to do the right things in every decision. We handpick the individual whose mindset is heading toward the engineering-driven vision that we're reaching. It doesn't matter to us if you apply without a university certificate, or impress us with +10 years of seniority. You're in once your skills are perfect for the job.\n\n## The Spirit of Knowledge Sharing\nHardly I heard a Dwarf refuse to explain or transfer what they know to others. Speaking from experience, I always get the help I need once I start to bring up the question. And even if they fail to answer at that time, eventually something will come up. They just can't stand the feeling of leaving a query unanswered. Odd, I know. But implementing a culture of sharing knowledge isn't a mandatory call. It was formed based on the urge to discover and exchange the grasp within the team. It's a process of becoming better and be open to help.\n\n## It's not the Rule. It's the People who follow.\nDespite how many office traps there are, nothing keeps people around unless ***they want it themselves***. Once there is a bunch of reasons to tie people around, they'll leave when there is a better reason from a better place. So in short, create a space where people feel active to work in and raise their idea, where they know their work means something, where judgments are fair and run by the right ideas. Focus on what people want to do, and things will run their courses.\n","title":"How People Matter Should Work","short_title":"","description":"A philosophical exploration of authentic employee engagement in software companies, focusing on individual contributions, unconventional hiring practices, knowledge sharing culture, and intrinsic motivation rather than superficial happiness metrics.","tags":["people","practice","operations"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao","duy"],"date":"Wed Jun 24 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playbook/operations/how-people-matter-should-work.md","slugArray":["playbook","operations","how-people-matter-should-work"]},{"content":"\nOur goal is to allocate resources efficiently, assign the right staff to the right tasks, and address issues appropriately.

Firms lean on that. It explains why companies are down to invest a fortune on building creative office with other benefit packages. There's nothing wrong about that. I'm just saying there are others ways to keep people excited without costing too much operation cost. \n\nThe Dwarves lives with some principles. First, we feel no need to manage your chairs. We have better things to do with our time. Meetings are for decision making. Ideas and planning should be conducted personally.\n\nThat brings us to the spring of 2020, aka, the Covid-19 outbreak. While many firms out there busting their ass on remotely operation management, Covid-19 didn't change us much. We stay on track with what we've adopted since day one: Virtual meeting, Basecamp, and G-suites.\n\nSo here are some points that keeps us sane in remote working:\n\n* **Self-preparation.** Once, a Dwarves got freaked out because he was about to attend a meeting which he just only remembered about 10 minutes in advance. I've never seen someone with that fast typing skill my whole life. Still, the meeting went well. But sure, no one wants that kind of mini-crisis.\n\n* **Time.** Flexible working time has its downside. Begin a workday at any time and anywhere you wish sounds perfect until the day went by, and you are left with no shit done. Time can be tricky. Manage your own. \n\n    Pomodoro is a time-management technique that allows us to focus on 25 minutes straight, then take a short break (for 5 or 10') for coffee or small talks. After the 4th time, award ourselves with a long break to recover. \n\n* **Work environment.** Whether it is your house, a co-working space, or the office, make it yours. I launched a mini-campaign few weeks ago called \"[Snapshot of your Home Desk](https://medium.com/dwarves-foundation/dfstaythefhome-5e416a4c457c)\", started by posting a picture of my table with an opened laptop, a cup of coffee, a note book and an unfinished bag of snack. The post received many replies from other teammates. Needless to say, it was exciting. \n\n* **Do your job.** Don't bother people with mundane tasks. Make sure you've tried all solutions before coming to them for advice.\n\n* **Document.** Working remotely means face-to-face discourse and body language are limited. That's when the documents dive in. Note down things and note it detailedly.\n","title":"Make Remote Working Works","short_title":"","description":"Being office-present keeps you effective.

Letting people know the direction means sharing the responsibility, and sharing the responsibility equals reducing the risk.\n\n## How we do that\nEverything flows in a flat hierarchy.

The decision-making power, by then, lies in the hand of those who do the work.\n\n### As long as it follows the 3x2 framework,\n* People x Customer x Number\n* Now x Then\n\n![](assets/making-decision-as-a-team-member_4824b7755ec089244dca64fc4a9d6fa3_md5.webp)\n\nAll the aspects are equal. Every business decision revolves around these things. A decision should benefit those aspects as much as possible. Keep asking yourself: Does this do anyone any favor? Is it possible to make a profit out of it? Can it be maintained?\n\nIt's about improvement. And it's okay if one or two of those aspects gets better. As long as the rest stay the same and don't get worse.\n\n### With Encouragement\nWe encourage members to make decisions. Thinking independently generates original ideas and splendid ways to make them work. We want that. Plus, isn't it cool to come up with good stuff and see them turn into real impact? Unless it's a provoke for revolution, making impact sounds and feels pretty awesome.\n\nBeing able to make decision trains ourselves to accept responsibility with an open mind. Either it's a success or a failure, we move forward.\n\n### And the people. Engage them.\nDecision-making is a team thing. And team involves people.\n\n3x2 doesn't allow you to make decisions in isolation. It requires you to seek information and advice from people around you. Seeking help doesn't take power away from you. It only makes the points more solid when you explain them afterward.\n\nYou'll be surprised at how those accumulated best knowledge can help in the long run. Data support can never go wrong. Advice provides insights. When we understand better, well, we do better.\n\n## But\nTo be honest, it doesn't work all the time. Because people are still scared of responsibility. I catch myself sometimes standing with hesitation in front of making any calls, mostly because I'm afraid I couldn't handle once the failure taps on my forehead. The best we can hope for is testing and testing. Until things get right on track.\n\nIn the event of raising ideas, better make sure there is a good reason behind. Answering the \"why\" instead of the \"how.\" And any resolution should come with backup scenarios in case things go south.\n","title":"Making Decision As A Team Member","short_title":"","description":"Being able to make decision trains ourselves to accept responsibility with an open mind.

They should have a good handle on the limitations provided by the time and resources available and should be able to prioritize to get things done as efficiently as possible. This metric will be calculated by the logged hours or total points that you have earned by getting things done.\n* Workload: how much effort you put into the project.\n* Quality: The quality of work your team members put out is perhaps the most important metric, but it is also the most difficult to define. Team members who care about what they do and are engaged at work will likely perform better, and it’s a good idea to recognize resulting achievements.\n\n*Example*:\nFindFriends: Han marks\n* Punctuality = 3\n* Workload = 3\n* Quality = 3\n\nPie: An marks\n* Punctuality = 4\n* Workload = 3\n* Quality = 3\nWith coefficient equal to 1\n\n ***R = 0.3 \\times (\\frac{3 + 3 + 3}{3}) + 0.7 \\times (\\frac{4 + 3 + 3}{3}) = 3.23***\n\n## Teamwork - T\nHow do you treat others?

Psychopaths are driven by short-term tangible rewards, and engage in reckless, antisocial behavior to get it. Machiavellians are fueled by long-term tangible rewards and will strategize schemes to get them. Narcissists are motivated by whatever boosts their ego, whether tangible rewards or simple praise that validates their idealized self-image.\n\nI am currently working on a tech startup. Our team have 8 people including product guys and biz guys. As you’ve known, there are many factors to make a success business and teamwork is one of them. I think this is the most important.\n\nStartup, in common sense, is found to solve people problems, real problems; is found to provide works for society, and also, to make money. That is a thing that people called the vision, team vision, company vision. As the team member, you should understand it clearly, love it or hate it and follow it, make it your life, your working purpose. Small team does not need employees but contributors.\n\nThe team still need heroes and there should be an i in the team but the only way to make the boat go fast is perfect coordination, it also means perfect teamwork and synchronization. Skill set is important but it is not important as vision and coordination. The i must be unselfish and think about the team first. As a team member, it’s important to remember that no one is perfect; everyone has something that they could improve upon, including yourself. So, be supportive. Offer constructive criticism. Listen, listen, listen. People who always talk, but never listen will be stunted in growth. Remember that everyone knows something you don’t know.\n\nWe effectively have an environment in which competition and collaboration co-exist and feed off each other. Competition, synchronization or collaborating perfectly; make the boat go fast is always the main point. Remember, even if you work harder than anyone else, if you lose synchronization, you slow the boat down.\n\n```plain_text\n\t*They told me there is no “I” in team.*\n\tI am an athlete.\n\tI am an individual.\n\tI am strong.\n\tI am weak.\n\tI have desires, hopes, and dreams.\n\tI have goals.\n\tI have fears.\n\tAs a team my opponent will never see my weaknesses.\n\tOnly my strength, never my fears, only my goals as they unfold before them.\n\tI am not afraid that my team will see my fears, my hopes, dreams, or desires.\n\tI trust them to an unlimited level.\n\tI am not afraid that my team will see my faults, because\n\tWith them I can overcome my faults, with them I am\n\tfearless, with them I have hopes and dreams.\n\tWith my team I am not weak, I do not have the strength\n\tof one athlete, but of many, combined, focused,\n\tAnd dangerous to my un-united opponent.\n\tI become my team and my team becomes me.\n\tI do not judge, and I am not judged.\n\tI have a goal, and the team has a goal.\n\tThe team goal is my goal.\n\tAll that matters is that the team reaches its goal.\n\tThey always told me there is no “I” in “Team”.\n\tThey were wrong.\n\tI am the team.\n\tI became the team.\n\tThe team became me.\n\tThe team becomes an entity unto itself.\n\tThe team is strong, creative, compassionate, caring,\n\tAuthoritative, disciplined.\n\tThe team absorbs “I”, and then there is “I” in “Team”.\n\tThe “I” becomes part of something much more powerful.\n\tThey were right there is no “I” in “Team”,\n\tBut there is “Team” in me.\n```\n\nSource: [It is hard to become a team member](http://tieubao.me/writing/2014/12/05/it-is-hard-to-become-a-team-member/)\n\n## Metrics\nCommunication: \n* Daily: You’re transparent with your manager and teams.\n* Presentation: you communicate effectively through keynote.\n* Written: From emails to blogs...you are a clear, concise, compelling and convincing writer. \n* Meetings: You involve the right people at the right time.

Specifically, this document addresses working from home on a regular basis. It goes valid for:\n\n* A full-remote team.\n* Individuals that manages and responsible for their work.\n\nEven when we aren't in the office, our teammates are still counting on us and it is our responsibility to make sure we are exceeding their expectations.\n\nAt the same time, it is the responsibility of workers in the office to reasonably accommodate remote workers. This means being willing to schedule meetings in light of timezone differences and to manage expectations around immediate feedback.\n\nThe guidelines in this document (and the handbook at large) give us tools to make remote work easier, but tooling is only a small part of the solution. Every employee needs to complement these tools with extra work to make remote work effective for the employee working remotely and the rest of our team.\n\n## Adoption\n\n### Plan & Prepare Beforehand\n\nIt's your responsibility to both make sure you are effective and don't let your teammates down ,  regardless of the location you work from. This means that you should plan & prepare in your free time before you leave to work remotely.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of things to ensure are in order are:\n\n* You will have a fast, consistent wi-fi connection\n* You will have a distraction-free environment to work in\n* You will have a quiet, private place to take phone calls and meetings\n* You will be able to work a full workday every day you're working remotely\n\n### Pro-active checkins\n\nWhen we're all in the office, it's easy to see when a teammate is around or available. When an individual is out of the office, this visibility immediately drops to 0. When we're working remotely, it's our responsibility to let our teammates know when we're around and available.\n\n**Doing this is as easy as posting a message in Slack to say when you drop in or leave.**\nIt's also a good idea to be proactive about letting teammates know what you're working on and how it's going. 18F has a great paragraph on this:\n\n> *Proactively communicate. As Kate Garklavs, a content designer who lives in Portland, puts it: “Because I'm remote, I've taken to sending short, proactive progress updates to my teams (\"Hey, all ,  wanted to let you know that I finished writing XYZ and sent it to so-and-so for approval ,  should hear back by Friday.\"), even when daily stand-ups aren't required. By sending these short updates throughout the day, I hope to keep folks in the loop with regards to what I've been up to.”*\n\nWith increased individual flexibility, since we're all working at the same time less, it's important to go above and beyond in letting people know when we are around.\n\n### Calendar Updates\n\nIf you're working remotely or from home, you should put a calendar event indicating where you are working from for all the time you are out of the office.\n\n### Extended Remote Work\n\nIf you're planning to work remotely for more than 3 consecutive days, or you're planning to work remotely from a place that's not your home (i.e. from a partner's home in a different city), you'll need to follow these additional guidelines. Even more than standard remote work, working remotely for an extended period of time is a privilege ,  it will require a large amount of extra work from you to make sure that the team is effective with you working remotely.\n\nIn order for an employee to work remotely for an extended period of time, they should have demonstrated in the past that they are effective working remotely and upholding their quality of work. If that's not the case, the manager can and should veto the option.\n\n## Schedule\n\n### Give the team heads up\n\nYou should give everyone on the team as much notice as possible, but at least 3 days. This will ensure everyone can plan their meetings and work accordingly.\n\nAlways take the following steps to let the team know:\n\n* Post in #office with a @channel tag so everyone sees the notification\n* Communicate verbally with the people you work closest with\n* Update your calendar to mark which days you are working remotely\n\n### Meeting: Proper setup for meeting\n<!-- synced_block 32ad30fb-9659-4e38-bb96-0f270a4bcf9c -->\n\n**Meetings start on time**\n\nIf you're leading a meeting, it's your responsibility to start the meeting on time. If you're attending a meeting, you are responsible for showing up on time.\n\n**Meetings happen in regular hours**\n\nAll team members should make themselves available for face-to-face meetings between 10:30am - 1:00p, as long as they are scheduled at least 24 hours in advance. If a meeting needs to happen outside of these hours, the meeting organizer should scheduled it a week in advance.\n\n**Meetings should have a video option**\nIf you're hosting a meeting with a remote worker invited, it's your responsibility to provide a video link before the meeting starts for them to join.\n\nIf you're attending a meeting remotely, you should join the video call before a meeting starts. It's your responsibility to ensure this is possible ,  this means being in a quiet place with a fast internet connection before the meeting starts. Calling into a meeting via phone or from a public place is unacceptable.\n\nFor some meetings, voice calls will be sufficient - this decision is up to the meeting organizer when they create the meeting.\n\n## Manager Retrospectives\n\n### Loss of the privilege\n\nHaving the flexibility to work remotely is a privilege. If an employee's unable to uphold the responsibilities that go along with that privilege, their manager should work with them through their 1:1s and dedicated retrospectives to resolve the issue. If the employe cannot resolve the issue, their manager can revoke the privilege.\n\n### Regular 1:1s\n\nIf an employee works remotely, they should make the topic of their remote work a regular part of weekly 1:1s.\n\nThis is a time where employees can voice concerns about constraints that are limiting their ability to work effectively: this could be concerns about structures inside of the company that limit their flexibility, concerns about how the way other teammates work, or anything else that might affect how they work. It's also a time where managers should give concrete feedback on whether an employee is upholding their responsibilities when they are working remotely.\n","title":"Our Policy For Remote Working","short_title":"","description":"Some useful practices we adopted to keep the remote working system goes smoothly.

There is a world inside ourselves, and a world outside ourselves. When we are dealing with the world outside of ourself, we are \"extraverting\". When we are inside our own minds, we are \"introverting\".\n\nWe are **extraverting** when we:\n\n* Talk to other people\n* Listen to what someone is saying\n* Cook dinner, or make a cup of coffee\n* Work on a car\n\nWe are **introverting** when we:\n\n* Read a book\n* Think about what we want to say or do\n* Are aware of how we feel\n* Think through a problem so that we understand it\n\nWithin the context of personality typing, the important distinction is which world we live in more often. Do we define our life's direction externally or internally? Which world gives us our energy, and which do we perhaps find draining?\n\n### Sensing and Intuition\nThe \"SN\" preference refers to how we gather information. We all need data on which to base our decisions. We gather data through our five senses. Jung contended that there are two distinct ways of perceiving the data that we gather. The \"Sensing\" preference absorbs data in a literal, concrete fashion. The \"Intuitive\" preference generates abstract possibilities from information that is gathered. We all use both Sensing and Intuition in our lives, but to different degrees of effectiveness and with different levels of comfort.\n\nWe are **Sensing** when we:\n\n* Taste food\n* Notice a stoplight has changed\n* Memorize a speech\n* Follow steps in a plan\n\nWe are **Intuitive** when we:\n\n* Come up with a new way of doing things\n* Think about future implications for a current action\n* Perceive underlying meaning in what people say or do\n* See the big picture\n\nWithin the context of personality typing, the important distinction is which method of gathering information do we trust the most? Do we rely on our five senses and want concrete, practical data to work with? Or do we trust our intuitions without necessarily building upon a solid foundation of facts?\n\n### Thinking and Feeling\nWhen Jung studied human behavior, he noticed that people have the capability to make decisions based on two very different sets of criteria: Thinking and Feeling. When someone makes a decision that is based on logic and reason, they are operating in Thinking mode. When someone makes a decision that is based on their value system, or what they believe to be right, they are operating in Feeling mode. We all use both modes for making decisions, but we put more trust into one mode or the other. A \"Thinker\" makes decisions in a rational, logical, impartial manner, based on what they believe to be fair and correct by pre-defined rules of behavior. A \"Feeler\" makes decisions on the individual case, in a subjective manner based on what they believe to be right within their own value systems.\n\nWe are making decisions in the **Thinking** mode when we:\n\n* Research a product via consumer reports, and buy the best one to meet our needs\n* Do \"The Right Thing\", whether or not we like it\n* Choose not to buy a blue shirt which we like, because we have two blue shirts\n* Establish guidelines to follow for performing tasks\n\nWe are making decisions in the **Feeling** mode when we:\n\n* Decide to buy something because we like it\n* Refrain from telling someone something which we feel may upset them\n* Decide not to take a job because we don't like the work environment\n* Decide to move somewhere to be close to someone we care about\n\nSome decisions are made entirely by Thinking or Feelings processes. Most decisions involve some Thinking and some Feeling. Decisions that we find most difficult are those in which we have conflicts between our Thinking and Feeling sides. In these situations, our dominant preference will take over. Decisions which we find easy to make and feel good about are usually a result of being in sync with both our Feeling and Thinking sides.\n\n### Judging and Perceiving\nJudging and Perceiving preferences, within the context of personality types, refers to our attitude towards the external world, and how we live our lives on a day-to-day basis. People with the Judging preference want things to be neat, orderly and established. The Perceiving preference wants things to be flexible and spontaneous. Judgers want things settled, Perceivers want thing open-ended.\n\nWe are using **Judging** when we:\n\n* Make a list of things to do\n* Schedule things in advance\n* Form and express judgments\n* Bring closure to an issue so that we can move on\n\nWe are using **Perceiving** when we:\n\n* Postpone decisions to see what other options are available\n* Act spontaneously\n* Decide what to do as we do it, rather than forming a plan ahead of time\n* Do things at the last minute\n\nWe all use both Judging and Perceiving as we live our day-to-day life. Within the context of personality type, the important distinction is which way of life do we lean towards, and are more comfortable with.\n\nThe differences between Judging and Perceiving are probably the most marked differences of all the four preferences. People with strong Judging preferences might have a hard time accepting people with strong Perceiving preferences, and vice-versa. On the other hand, a \"mixed\" couple (one Perceiving and one Judging) can complement each other very well, if they have developed themselves enough to be able to accept each other's differences.\n\nSource: [The Four Preferences](https://www.personalitypage.com/html/four-prefs.html)","title":"The Four Preferences","short_title":"","description":"The four preferences in MBTI personalities","tags":["mbti","personalities","operations"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["namtran"],"date":"Fri Jul 16 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playbook/operations/the-four-preferences.md","slugArray":["playbook","operations","the-four-preferences"]},{"content":"The concept of an \"inner circle\" within a company is not a new one, and at Dwarves, a software company founded by a group of engineers, this idea holds a significant value. Starting from scratch, the company has always placed emphasis on being surrounded by individuals who can efficiently ship software and don't waste time on unimportant tasks. These individuals are highly respected and valued within the company, as they play a crucial role in the development and success of projects.\n\nIt's not difficult to differentiate between those who can effectively contribute to the shipping process and those who cannot. Those who lack the ability to ship software efficiently are often viewed as a hindrance to the team and are not given the same level of respect and attention. This concept of valuing those who can effectively contribute to the development and shipping process is not exclusive to Dwarves, but is a structure found in many groups and organizations.\n\nAt Dwarves, there is also an inner circle of individuals who run the company and play a pivotal role during times of crisis. This inner circle is not formed through official invitations or set criteria, but rather through earning the respect and recognition of the group. Those who consistently demonstrate their value and ability to contribute to the development and success of the company are the ones who are recognized and included in this inner circle.\n\nIt is not about who one knows or what they have done in the past, but rather, it's about consistently showing that they matter and can make a significant impact on the company's success.

In 1981, George T. Doran, a consultant and former director of corporate planning for Washington Water Power Company, published a paper called, “There’s a S.M.A.R.T. Way to Write Management’s Goals and Objectives.” In the document, he introduces S.M.A.R.T. goals as a tool to create criteria to help improve the chances of succeeding in accomplishing a goal_\n\n## S – Specific\nWhen setting a goal, be specific about what you want to accomplish. Think about this as the mission statement for your goal. This isn’t a detailed list of how you’re going to meet a goal, but it should include an answer to the popular ‘w’ questions:\n* Who – Consider who needs to be involved to achieve the goal (this is especially important when you’re working on a group project).\n* What – Think about exactly what you are trying to accomplish and don’t be afraid to get very detailed.\n* When – You’ll get more specific about this question under the “time-bound” section of defining S.M.A.R.T. goals, but you should at least set a time frame.\n* Where – This question may not always apply, especially if you’re setting personal goals, but if there’s a location or relevant event, identify it here.\n* Which – Determine any related obstacles or requirements. This question can be beneficial in deciding if your goal is realistic. For example, if the goal is to open a baking business, but you’ve never baked anything before, that might be an issue. As a result, you may refine the specifics of the goal to be “Learn how to bake in order to open a baking business.\"\n* Why – What is the reason for the goal? When it comes to using this method for employees, the answer will likely be along the lines of company advancement or career development.\n\n_Incorrect Goal: Make a cross - browser layout of the www.site.com. Correct Goal: www.site.com must be equally displayed in browsers IE6+, Opera 6+, and Firefox 2+_\n_Incorrect Goal: Make a valid layout of the www.site.com. Correct Goal: www.site.com must completely pass check validators w3c.org_\n\n## M – Measurable\nWhat metrics are you going to use to determine if you meet the goal? This makes a goal more tangible because it provides a way to measure progress. If it’s a project that’s going to take a few months to complete, then set some milestones by considering specific tasks to accomplish.\n\n_Incorrect Goal: Increase traffic on the site. Correct Goal: The traffic on the site must be 2,000 visitors per day. Incorrect Goal: Make every visitor to buy more. Correct Goal: Increase the sum of an average check by 10%._\n\n## A – Achievable/Attainable\nThis focuses on how important a goal is to you and what you can do to make it attainable and may require developing new skills and changing attitudes. The goal is meant to inspire motivation, not discouragement. Think about how to accomplish the goal and if you have the tools/skills needed. If you don’t currently possess those tools/skills, consider what it would take to attain them.\n\n## R – Relevant\nRelevance refers focusing on something that makes sense with the broader business goals. For example, if the goal is to launch a new product, it should be something that’s in alignment with the overall business objectives. Your team may be able to launch a new consumer product, but if your company is a B2B that is not expanding into the consumer market, then the goal wouldn’t be relevant.\n\n## T – Time-Bound\nAnyone can set goals, but if it lacks realistic timing, chances are you’re not going to succeed. Providing a target date for deliverables is imperative. Ask specific questions about the goal deadline and what can be accomplished within that time period. If the goal will take three months to complete, it’s useful to define what should be achieved half-way through the process. Providing time constraints also creates a sense of urgency\n\n_Incorrect Goal: Make on the website the section “Contact Us” for a demonstration to the client by tomorrow.Correct Goal: Make on the website the section “Contact Us” for demonstration to the client by noon 6/10/2016._\n\n## Example: Email Subscription Goal\n* **Specific:** I want to boost the number of our email blog subscribers by increasing our Facebook advertising budget on blog posts that historically acquire the most email subscribers.\n* **Measurable:** A 50% increase is our goal.\n* **Attainable:** Since we started using this tactic three months ago, our email blog subscriptions have increased by 40%.\n* **Relevant:** By increasing the number of our email blog subscribers, our blog will drive more traffic, boost brand awareness, and drive more leads to our sales team.\n* **Time**-**Bound:** In 3 months.\n\n→ **SMART Goal:** In 3 months, we'll see a 50% increase in the number of our email blog subscribers by increasing our Facebook advertising budget on posts that historically acquire the most blog subscribers\n","title":"Writing Management Objectives In Smart","short_title":"","description":"Use S.M.A.R.T goal to define management objectives","tags":["operations","tips","goal"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["han"],"date":"Tue Feb 25 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"playbook/operations/writing-management-objectives-in-smart.md","slugArray":["playbook","operations","writing-management-objectives-in-smart"]}],"isListPage":true},"__N_SSG":true}
