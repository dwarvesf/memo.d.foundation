2-cor3_co_0: Discord\n00:04:50: 2-cor3_co_0: Nó là cái trò gì đó\n00:04:52: 2-cor3_co_0: Nhưng mà chủ yếu là cái process của nó\n00:04:55: 2-cor3_co_0: Từ lúc mà\n00:04:56: 2-cor3_co_0: Có ID tới lúc mà\n00:04:58: 2-cor3_co_0: Rồi sản phẩm\n00:05:00: 2-cor3_co_0: Cho user của nó\n00:05:02: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì nó sẽ coi những bước nào thôi\n00:05:04: 2-cor3_co_0: Cũng không phải là ứng dụng gì\n00:05:06: 2-cor3_co_0: Phùng khiếp của thằng\n00:05:07: 2-cor3_co_0: Giờ\n00:05:08: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì nó là kiểu\n00:05:11: 2-cor3_co_0: Mọi người thấy slide không vậy\n00:05:16: 2-cor3_co_0: Ok

2-cor3_co_0: thật ra cái bài article của tụi nó\n00:05:50: 2-cor3_co_0: cũng chả có gì nhiều đâu\n00:05:51: 2-cor3_co_0: nên là chắc là sẽ chen vô\n00:05:54: 2-cor3_co_0: tí để mọi người biết\n00:05:55: 2-cor3_co_0: cái Centrally Trip AI\n00:05:57: 2-cor3_co_0: tụi nó hay nói là cái gì thôi\n00:05:59: 2-cor3_co_0: có cái base trước rồi\n00:06:00: 2-cor3_co_0: mới biết là ok tụi nó xài nó để làm cái gì\n00:06:04: 2-cor3_co_0: thì\n00:06:05: 2-cor3_co_0: cái agenda hôm nay là\n00:06:09: 2-cor3_co_0: Centrally Trip AI 101 thôi\n00:06:11: 2-cor3_co_0: đó là cái kiểu một cái tám tác nhỏ của cái process mà tụi nó sử dụng Generative AI\n00:06:17: 2-cor3_co_0: để làm cái quá trình mà tụi nó apply cái Generative AI vô cho mấy cái user,\n00:06:26: 2-cor3_co_0: mấy task của user hoặc là mấy cái use case của tụi nó.\n00:06:31: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì Generative AI 101 là,\n00:06:33: 2-cor3_co_0: Gần đây thì nghe nó thôi\n00:06:36: 2-cor3_co_0: Nhưng mà cái thằng đó\n00:06:37: 2-cor3_co_0: Nó là một phần\n00:06:40: 2-cor3_co_0: Trong cái\n00:06:41: 2-cor3_co_0: Nguyên cái bức tranh của tụi AI\n00:06:44: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì AI là\n00:06:45: 2-cor3_co_0: Một cái\n00:06:46: 2-cor3_co_0: Kiểu\n00:06:49: 2-cor3_co_0: Một cái nhánh của thằng\n00:06:52: 2-cor3_co_0: Computer Science\n00:06:54: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì nó để\n00:06:55: 2-cor3_co_0: Giả lập lại những cái hành vi và suy nghĩ\n00:06:57: 2-cor3_co_0: Giống như con người\n00:06:58: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì\n00:07:01: 2-cor3_co_0: phát triển\n00:07:03: 2-cor3_co_0: hơn tí\n00:07:06: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó có trong\n00:07:07: 2-cor3_co_0: thằng AI sẽ có một cái gọi là machine learning\n00:07:10: 2-cor3_co_0: machine learning là thằng\n00:07:11: 2-cor3_co_0: tiếp theo của\n00:07:13: 2-cor3_co_0: trong một cái\n00:07:15: 2-cor3_co_0: sub-set nhỏ trong cái thằng\n00:07:17: 2-cor3_co_0: AI\n00:07:18: 2-cor3_co_0: thì machine learning là\n00:07:20: 2-cor3_co_0: nó sẽ là nó build những cái model\n00:07:23: 2-cor3_co_0: để nó\n00:07:24: 2-cor3_co_0: để cho máy có thể học được\n00:07:31: 2-cor3_co_0: và nó có thể đưa ra những cái\n00:07:33: 2-cor3_co_0: prediction\n00:07:34: 2-cor3_co_0: về\n00:07:37: 2-cor3_co_0: kiểu như là\n00:07:40: 2-cor3_co_0: một cái programming bình thường\n00:07:42: 2-cor3_co_0: thì mình sẽ đưa ra những cái\n00:07:44: 2-cor3_co_0: những cái rule\n00:07:47: 2-cor3_co_0: những cái quy chuẩn cho thằng máy\n00:07:49: 2-cor3_co_0: nó làm theo y chang vậy thôi\n00:07:50: 2-cor3_co_0: và ra quýt bá y chang\n00:07:52: 2-cor3_co_0: input vậy, output vậy\n00:07:54: 2-cor3_co_0: nó sẽ không biết được\n00:07:56: 2-cor3_co_0: nó không có kiểu là\n00:07:57: 2-cor3_co_0: kiểu unstructure\n00:08:00: 2-cor3_co_0: Bây giờ data, mình sẽ có tập input, đi qua một cái process thì nó ra một cặp output cố định,\n00:08:10: 2-cor3_co_0: thì đó là một programming bình thường của mình.\n00:08:12: 2-cor3_co_0: Còn machine learning, đi qua model thì nó ra một cái output mà nó không xác định trước.\n00:08:20: 2-cor3_co_0: nó có thể là cái kéo bút nó khá là rộng\n00:08:24: 2-cor3_co_0: và\n00:08:24: 2-cor3_co_0: nó phải phụ thuộc vào cái\n00:08:27: 2-cor3_co_0: mô độ mà mình training\n00:08:29: 2-cor3_co_0: tập data mình training\n00:08:31: 2-cor3_co_0: thì đó là cái machine learning\n00:08:33: 2-cor3_co_0: thì trong\n00:08:37: 2-cor3_co_0: machine learning sẽ có rất nhiều cái\n00:08:39: 2-cor3_co_0: loại machine learning\n00:08:41: 2-cor3_co_0: như là\n00:08:42: 2-cor3_co_0: supervised, unsupervised\n00:08:45: 2-cor3_co_0: semi-supervised gì đó\n00:08:47: 2-cor3_co_0: rồi deep learning, natural network\n00:08:49: 2-cor3_co_0: thì đó là\n00:08:51: 2-cor3_co_0: mấy cái loại\n00:08:53: 2-cor3_co_0: trong những cái nhánh nhỏ\n00:08:56: 2-cor3_co_0: trong cái thằng machine learning\n00:08:57: 2-cor3_co_0: thì sau đó\n00:08:59: 2-cor3_co_0: cái thằng phát triển\n00:09:01: 2-cor3_co_0: mà được nhiều người biết tới nhất\n00:09:03: 2-cor3_co_0: đó là cái Neural Network\n00:09:04: 2-cor3_co_0: Neural Network là tụi nó sẽ giả lập lại\n00:09:07: 2-cor3_co_0: cái\n00:09:07: 2-cor3_co_0: là một cái loại machine learning\n00:09:10: 2-cor3_co_0: mà tụi nó giả lập lại cái cách hoạt động\n00:09:13: 2-cor3_co_0: của cái neutron của\n00:09:14: 2-cor3_co_0: con người\n00:09:15: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó sẽ có nhiều layer trong đó\n00:09:19: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì trong một cái Neural Network thì nó sẽ có một cái subset nhỏ hơn nữa.\n00:09:26: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì subset đó nó gọi là Deep Learning.\n00:09:29: 2-cor3_co_0: Deep Learning nó là những cái model Neural Network nhưng mà nó sẽ có nhiều hơn 3 layer trở lên.\n00:09:36: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì là nó sẽ có rất nhiều layer để nó, mỗi layer, mỗi hidden layer nó sẽ filter data để nó ra được một cái output.\n00:09:44: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì tưởng tượng là deep learning\n00:09:47: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì nó sẽ có\n00:09:48: 2-cor3_co_0: Nhiều hơn 3 cái layer\n00:09:51: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì nó sẽ là deep learning\n00:09:51: 2-cor3_co_0: Sau deep learning\n00:09:55: 2-cor3_co_0: Deep learning cách đây chắc\n00:09:56: 2-cor3_co_0: 10, 20, 18, 19 gì đó\n00:09:58: 2-cor3_co_0: Nó khá là nổi\n00:09:59: 2-cor3_co_0: Nhưng mà kiểu phức tạp quá\n00:10:02: 2-cor3_co_0: Cho ai làm tới\n00:10:03: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì nó mới đi tới\n00:10:05: 2-cor3_co_0: Bước sau là cái thằng\n00:10:07: 2-cor3_co_0: Generative AI\n00:10:09: 2-cor3_co_0: Là cái mà năm ngoái với năm nay\n00:10:12: 2-cor3_co_0: Mọi người nghĩ rất là nhiều về nó\n00:10:13: 2-cor3_co_0: thì Generative AI thì nó sẽ gần hơn\n00:10:16: 2-cor3_co_0: với cái việc là\n00:10:18: 2-cor3_co_0: tạo ra những cái\n00:10:20: 2-cor3_co_0: nó là\n00:10:22: 2-cor3_co_0: nó là\n00:10:23: 2-cor3_co_0: nó là\n00:10:25: 2-cor3_co_0: combine lại rất là nhiều thứ để ra được\n00:10:28: 2-cor3_co_0: những cái gọi là\n00:10:29: 2-cor3_co_0: generate ra những cái\n00:10:32: 2-cor3_co_0: text, những cái video\n00:10:34: 2-cor3_co_0: dựa vào những cái\n00:10:37: 2-cor3_co_0: input của mình\n00:10:39: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó là\n00:10:40: 2-cor3_co_0: Generative AI\n00:10:41: 2-cor3_co_0: còn\n00:10:43: 2-cor3_co_0: nhỏ hơn channel A\n00:10:45: 2-cor3_co_0: đó là MLM\n00:10:47: 2-cor3_co_0: thì MLM nó là tập trung\n00:10:50: 2-cor3_co_0: nhiều hơn về bên cái phần\n00:10:51: 2-cor3_co_0: NLP\n00:10:52: 2-cor3_co_0: NLP là cái\n00:10:54: 2-cor3_co_0: Natural Language Processing\n00:10:59: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó là\n00:11:00: 2-cor3_co_0: dạng\n00:11:01: 2-cor3_co_0: mấy con chat CPT đó\n00:11:02: 2-cor3_co_0: nó chính là MLM\n00:11:04: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó chỉ chuyên tập trung cho cái việc\n00:11:07: 2-cor3_co_0: là generate ra những cái\n00:11:09: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì mình like\n00:11:10: 2-cor3_co_0: Đang với tôi\n00:11:11: 2-cor3_co_0: Ờ\n00:11:12: 2-cor3_co_0: Chỉ là bức tranh tổng thể\n00:11:15: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì\n00:11:15: 2-cor3_co_0: Để mọi người nắm được là\n00:11:17: 2-cor3_co_0: Khi mà người ta nói\n00:11:18: 2-cor3_co_0: Tới những cái này\n00:11:19: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì\n00:11:20: 2-cor3_co_0: Nó đang ở\n00:11:21: 2-cor3_co_0: Cái bước nào rồi\n00:11:22: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì mình đang ở\n00:11:23: 2-cor3_co_0: State\n00:11:23: 2-cor3_co_0: Của cái\n00:11:24: 2-cor3_co_0: Generate AI rồi\n00:11:25: 2-cor3_co_0: Là cái mà\n00:11:26: 2-cor3_co_0: Tụi nó\n00:11:27: 2-cor3_co_0: Có thể\n00:11:28: 2-cor3_co_0: Tạo ra\n00:11:29: 2-cor3_co_0: Những cái\n00:11:30: 2-cor3_co_0: Ờ\n00:11:31: 2-cor3_co_0: Text\n00:11:33: 2-cor3_co_0: Video\n00:11:33: 2-cor3_co_0: Ờ\n00:11:35: 2-cor3_co_0: Rồi\n00:11:38: 2-cor3_co_0: thì cái là bức tranh tâm thể\n00:11:41: 2-cor3_co_0: về Generative AI\n00:11:43: 2-cor3_co_0: thì cái bài báo hôm trước\n00:11:48: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó sẽ\n00:11:49: 2-cor3_co_0: của thằng Discord nó sẽ\n00:11:51: 2-cor3_co_0: tập trung về cái thằng mà\n00:11:53: 2-cor3_co_0: về cái process mà tụi nó sử dụng\n00:11:56: 2-cor3_co_0: cái Generative AI này\n00:11:57: 2-cor3_co_0: cho cái idea của nó\n00:11:59: 2-cor3_co_0: thì cái process nó cũng giống như là\n00:12:02: 2-cor3_co_0: cái quy trình phát triển phần mềm của mình\n00:12:04: 2-cor3_co_0: đó giờ hết\n00:12:04: 2-cor3_co_0: nó cũng đi từ idea tới MVP này đó\n00:12:07: 2-cor3_co_0: thì trong quá trình đi từ IDA đến MVP\n00:12:10: 2-cor3_co_0: cho một cái\n00:12:11: 2-cor3_co_0: cái ứng dụng\n00:12:14: 2-cor3_co_0: của Genki.ai thì nó sẽ trải qua\n00:12:16: 2-cor3_co_0: những bước nào để mình biết là\n00:12:18: 2-cor3_co_0: sau này mình có dư sky như vậy\n00:12:20: 2-cor3_co_0: mình muốn xài thì mình nên làm\n00:12:22: 2-cor3_co_0: theo những bước đó cho nó kiểu\n00:12:24: 2-cor3_co_0: nó có quy trình\n00:12:26: 2-cor3_co_0: rồi nó ra được cái kết quả\n00:12:28: 2-cor3_co_0: nó ok tí\n00:12:29: 2-cor3_co_0: thì cái đó là cái quy trình của nó\n00:12:31: 2-cor3_co_0: để nó chia sẻ\n00:12:32: 2-cor3_co_0: thì đầu tiên nó vẫn là\n00:12:35: 2-cor3_co_0: cái quy trình cơ bản của nó vẫn là\n00:12:37: 2-cor3_co_0: có idea, rồi bắt đầu sẽ define những cái requirement\n00:12:43: 2-cor3_co_0: sau khi có những requirement của cái idea đó sẽ là prototype\n00:12:48: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó dùng cái prototype này để đi, nó quăng qua những cái model trên thị trường hiện tại\n00:12:55: 2-cor3_co_0: nó validate rồi nó quay về, nó validate liên tục tiên tục\n00:13:01: 2-cor3_co_0: để nó biết được một cái mô đồ chuẩn nhất,\n00:13:08: 2-cor3_co_0: có output nó kiểu sát với lại cái expectation của nó nhất.\n00:13:13: 2-cor3_co_0: Sau đó tụi nó sẽ deploy lên cái môi trường để cho tự do sơ sải.\n00:13:19: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì cái quá trình idea này chắc cũng là cũng đơn giản thôi, mình bỏ qua nha.\n00:13:25: 2-cor3_co_0: Cái define, trong cái quy trình mà mình define cái requirement á,\n00:13:29: 2-cor3_co_0: thì tụi nó có nhắc đến một vài cái factor\n00:13:31: 2-cor3_co_0: mà khi mà mình define\n00:13:33: 2-cor3_co_0: rồi requirement mình nên để ý\n00:13:35: 2-cor3_co_0: thì giống như là\n00:13:36: 2-cor3_co_0: sẽ có vài factor như là cái latency\n00:13:39: 2-cor3_co_0: về cái độ trễ\n00:13:41: 2-cor3_co_0: khi mà mình sử dụng\n00:13:43: 2-cor3_co_0: RAM model gì đó\n00:13:44: 2-cor3_co_0: thì khi mà mình đưa một input\n00:13:47: 2-cor3_co_0: đưa một input vô thì bao lâu\n00:13:49: 2-cor3_co_0: sẽ output cho user\n00:13:50: 2-cor3_co_0: cái task complexity\n00:13:53: 2-cor3_co_0: là cái task của mình\n00:13:55: 2-cor3_co_0: nó có phức tạp hay không\n00:13:56: 2-cor3_co_0: cái vấn đề mình cần giải quyết nó phức tạp tới mức nào\n00:13:59: 2-cor3_co_0: để mình viết được là cái model nào\n00:14:02: 2-cor3_co_0: sẽ phù hợp với mình\n00:14:03: 2-cor3_co_0: cái prompt length\n00:14:05: 2-cor3_co_0: thì đó là cái context mình input cho\n00:14:08: 2-cor3_co_0: cái thằng model đó\n00:14:10: 2-cor3_co_0: sẽ giống như mình\n00:14:11: 2-cor3_co_0: một cái task của mình\n00:14:13: 2-cor3_co_0: để mà thằng model đó\n00:14:16: 2-cor3_co_0: nó hiểu được cái task\n00:14:18: 2-cor3_co_0: và nó đưa ra các boost đó\n00:14:20: 2-cor3_co_0: thì\n00:14:20: 2-cor3_co_0: mình sẽ input một cái context\n00:14:24: 2-cor3_co_0: thì mình cũng nên consider\n00:14:26: 2-cor3_co_0: là ok cái model\n00:14:28: 2-cor3_co_0: có thể nhận được content\n00:14:29: 2-cor3_co_0: lên là bao nhiêu\n00:14:30: 2-cor3_co_0: để mình biết được là\n00:14:33: 2-cor3_co_0: nó có phù hợp\n00:14:36: 2-cor3_co_0: với cái task của mình hay không\n00:14:37: 2-cor3_co_0: cái nữa là\n00:14:40: 2-cor3_co_0: cái quality của cái output\n00:14:41: 2-cor3_co_0: của thằng kiểu model đó\n00:14:43: 2-cor3_co_0: nó có đảm bảo được\n00:14:45: 2-cor3_co_0: là nó giải quyết được vấn đề của mình hay không\n00:14:47: 2-cor3_co_0: safety\n00:14:50: 2-cor3_co_0: là mấy cái factor\n00:14:51: 2-cor3_co_0: về mấy cái kiểu\n00:14:53: 2-cor3_co_0: về\n00:14:54: 2-cor3_co_0: content\n00:14:56: 2-cor3_co_0: cái\n00:14:57: 2-cor3_co_0: cái output của thằng\n00:15:00: 2-cor3_co_0: em model của\n00:15:02: 2-cor3_co_0: cái RM đó\n00:15:03: 2-cor3_co_0: nó có\n00:15:06: 2-cor3_co_0: kiểu như là\n00:15:09: 2-cor3_co_0: mấy cái proxy của mình\n00:15:10: 2-cor3_co_0: nó có đáp ứng được hay không\n00:15:12: 2-cor3_co_0: kiểu như trong user\n00:15:14: 2-cor3_co_0: user data thì nó có được\n00:15:16: 2-cor3_co_0: liên quan lý ra hay không\n00:15:18: 2-cor3_co_0: rồi mấy cái content\n00:15:20: 2-cor3_co_0: mấy cái\n00:15:21: 2-cor3_co_0: 18 cộng là 3 gì đó\n00:15:24: 2-cor3_co_0: nó có kiểu\n00:15:26: 2-cor3_co_0: project với nó hay không\n00:15:27: 2-cor3_co_0: rồi\n00:15:28: 2-cor3_co_0: we play with support\n00:15:29: 2-cor3_co_0: thì\n00:15:30: 2-cor3_co_0: support bao nhiêu\n00:15:31: 2-cor3_co_0: language\n00:15:31: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó là\n00:15:32: 2-cor3_co_0: estimative query\n00:15:34: 2-cor3_co_0: per second\n00:15:35: 2-cor3_co_0: thì\n00:15:36: 2-cor3_co_0: nó cũng tìm ra\n00:15:37: 2-cor3_co_0: performance của\n00:15:38: 2-cor3_co_0: cái\n00:15:38: 2-cor3_co_0: NUP đó\n00:15:39: 2-cor3_co_0: you know\n00:15:42: 2-cor3_co_0: vài\n00:15:43: 2-cor3_co_0: vài\n00:15:43: 2-cor3_co_0: let's try\n00:15:44: 2-cor3_co_0: khi mình\n00:15:45: 2-cor3_co_0: define\n00:15:46: 2-cor3_co_0: cái requirement\n00:15:47: 2-cor3_co_0: thì\n00:15:48: 2-cor3_co_0: trong\n00:15:49: 2-cor3_co_0: tùy\n00:15:50: 2-cor3_co_0: few case thôi\n00:15:51: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nếu mà mình có\n00:15:52: 2-cor3_co_0: few case khác\n00:15:53: 2-cor3_co_0: mình cần\n00:15:53: 2-cor3_co_0: cái factor khác\n00:15:55: 2-cor3_co_0: mình có\n00:15:55: 2-cor3_co_0: để mình consider khi mà mình bắt đầu mình lên cái prototype để mình chọn cái model nào phù hợp cho cái product của mình\n00:16:05: 2-cor3_co_0: Sau quá trình define cái requirement rồi thì mình có prototype\n00:16:13: 2-cor3_co_0: mình scope out lại là mình nên chọn những cái model nào có sẵn trên thị trường để mình test nó\n00:16:21: 2-cor3_co_0: Khi mình test, sau khi mình mix model, mình sẽ làm sao để value được model có phù hợp với product và view case của mình\n00:16:39: 2-cor3_co_0: thì cái quá trình đó người ta gọi là quá trình\n00:16:43: 2-cor3_co_0: evaluating cái prompt của mình\n00:16:45: 2-cor3_co_0: thì\n00:16:46: 2-cor3_co_0: nếu mà mình biết mô đồ\n00:16:48: 2-cor3_co_0: trên thị trường sẽ có kiểu\n00:16:49: 2-cor3_co_0: hiện tại có kiểu quá nhiều mô đồ\n00:16:52: 2-cor3_co_0: vài chục vài trăm mô đồ vậy đó\n00:16:54: 2-cor3_co_0: thì mình cũng không biết là thằng nào nó phù hợp với mình\n00:16:56: 2-cor3_co_0: rồi mình sẽ có\n00:16:58: 2-cor3_co_0: cái prompt để mình\n00:17:00: 2-cor3_co_0: giải quyết\n00:17:01: 2-cor3_co_0: để mình đưa cho nó\n00:17:04: 2-cor3_co_0: để nó generate cho mình\n00:17:06: 2-cor3_co_0: cái output\n00:17:07: 2-cor3_co_0: thì mình cũng không biết là cái ROM nào\n00:17:09: 2-cor3_co_0: nó sẽ cho ra kết quả\n00:17:11: 2-cor3_co_0: ok nhất với mình\n00:17:12: 2-cor3_co_0: thì mình sẽ có quá trình\n00:17:14: 2-cor3_co_0: evalu cái ROM của mình\n00:17:17: 2-cor3_co_0: và biết cái mô đồ\n00:17:18: 2-cor3_co_0: thì\n00:17:20: 2-cor3_co_0: đây là cái set cơ bản\n00:17:23: 2-cor3_co_0: mà tụi nó đưa ra thôi\n00:17:25: 2-cor3_co_0: quá trình evalu này nó có nhiều thứ\n00:17:27: 2-cor3_co_0: trong đây, kiểu như là\n00:17:29: 2-cor3_co_0: mình đưa vào\n00:17:32: 2-cor3_co_0: cái input là cho một cái mô đồ\n00:17:33: 2-cor3_co_0: mô đồ nào đó\n00:17:34: 2-cor3_co_0: viết story\n00:17:37: 2-cor3_co_0: about\n00:17:38: 2-cor3_co_0: quân bớt gì gì đó\n00:17:40: 2-cor3_co_0: thì đưa ra cho\n00:17:41: 2-cor3_co_0: một cái thằng model\n00:17:42: 2-cor3_co_0: nó gọi là cái\n00:17:44: 2-cor3_co_0: inferencing model\n00:17:45: 2-cor3_co_0: gì đó\n00:17:46: 2-cor3_co_0: rồi thằng này\n00:17:47: 2-cor3_co_0: nó sẽ đưa ra\n00:17:48: 2-cor3_co_0: cái output là\n00:17:48: 2-cor3_co_0: ok\n00:17:49: 2-cor3_co_0: nó là cái gì đó\n00:17:50: 2-cor3_co_0: once a month\n00:17:51: 2-cor3_co_0: a time\n00:17:51: 2-cor3_co_0: gì đó\n00:17:52: 2-cor3_co_0: thì mình có lúc đầu\n00:17:53: 2-cor3_co_0: mình lấy thằng này\n00:17:54: 2-cor3_co_0: mình đưa cho một thằng khác\n00:17:56: 2-cor3_co_0: cái thằng này\n00:17:57: 2-cor3_co_0: nó sẽ gọi là\n00:17:57: 2-cor3_co_0: cái secret model\n00:17:58: 2-cor3_co_0: cái crisis model này\n00:18:00: 2-cor3_co_0: critic model này\n00:18:01: 2-cor3_co_0: nó\n00:18:01: 2-cor3_co_0: sẽ làm nhiệm vụ là\n00:18:03: 2-cor3_co_0: nó đánh giá\n00:18:04: 2-cor3_co_0: nó phê bình cái output của thằng kia\n00:18:06: 2-cor3_co_0: thì sau khi mà có được\n00:18:09: 2-cor3_co_0: cái lách giá về mình đó\n00:18:10: 2-cor3_co_0: thì mình sẽ có lòng hãy ngược lại cho cái thằng kia\n00:18:13: 2-cor3_co_0: để tự động optimize\n00:18:15: 2-cor3_co_0: cái kết quả\n00:18:16: 2-cor3_co_0: và cái prompt của mình gì đó\n00:18:18: 2-cor3_co_0: thì cái quá trình này nó sẽ bị lật lại\n00:18:21: 2-cor3_co_0: cho đến khi nào mà\n00:18:22: 2-cor3_co_0: mình có được cái prompt\n00:18:24: 2-cor3_co_0: và cái output\n00:18:25: 2-cor3_co_0: tốt nhất và gần sát\n00:18:28: 2-cor3_co_0: với lại cái dự kê của mình nhất\n00:18:30: 2-cor3_co_0: thì cái big big này\n00:18:32: 2-cor3_co_0: thì cái tôi Discord nó đang nói là\n00:18:34: 2-cor3_co_0: nó sẽ biết cái best in class\n00:18:36: 2-cor3_co_0: model để nó làm cái thằng\n00:18:38: 2-cor3_co_0: Crystic này\n00:18:39: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó sẽ sử dụng cái GPT-4\n00:18:43: 2-cor3_co_0: để nó\n00:18:44: 2-cor3_co_0: evaluate cái\n00:18:46: 2-cor3_co_0: output của tụi\n00:18:47: 2-cor3_co_0: những cái model inferencing\n00:18:49: 2-cor3_co_0: thì\n00:18:52: 2-cor3_co_0: thì đó là cái quá trình\n00:18:54: 2-cor3_co_0: mà tụi nó đánh giá\n00:18:55: 2-cor3_co_0: lặp đi lặp lại để mà tụi nó tìm ra được\n00:18:58: 2-cor3_co_0: cái from và cái model\n00:19:00: 2-cor3_co_0: phù hợp nhất cho cái UK và cái product\n00:19:02: 2-cor3_co_0: thì sau cái quá trình này\n00:19:07: 2-cor3_co_0: đã tìm được một cái\n00:19:08: 2-cor3_co_0: UK product rồi\n00:19:10: 2-cor3_co_0: tìm được model phù hợp\n00:19:12: 2-cor3_co_0: thì sẽ bắt đầu\n00:19:14: 2-cor3_co_0: quăng lên deploy\n00:19:16: 2-cor3_co_0: deploy thì nó sẽ quay lại\n00:19:18: 2-cor3_co_0: vấn đề trái đất của mình\n00:19:20: 2-cor3_co_0: tự deploy\n00:19:23: 2-cor3_co_0: xài model quả sẵn\n00:19:24: 2-cor3_co_0: và self-hub cái model\n00:19:25: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó cũng là cái việc\n00:19:28: 2-cor3_co_0: mà mình trade off giữa cái việc là\n00:19:30: 2-cor3_co_0: mình sẵn sàng trả tiền cho tụi nó\n00:19:32: 2-cor3_co_0: để xài cái API của tụi này\n00:19:34: 2-cor3_co_0: có sẵn, không cần phải maintain\n00:19:36: 2-cor3_co_0: không cần be user\n00:19:37: 2-cor3_co_0: chỉ cần\n00:19:40: 2-cor3_co_0: sử dụng API xong rồi lấy output\n00:19:42: 2-cor3_co_0: xong rồi mình đi verify\n00:19:44: 2-cor3_co_0: mình đi write cái output này\n00:19:47: 2-cor3_co_0: coi là nó có phù hợp\n00:19:48: 2-cor3_co_0: với lại cái tiêu chuẩn của mình không\n00:19:50: 2-cor3_co_0: rồi mình mới\n00:19:52: 2-cor3_co_0: format cái output đưa về cho user\n00:19:54: 2-cor3_co_0: thì cái này là\n00:19:56: 2-cor3_co_0: quá trình mà 1 cái 2 level\n00:19:58: 2-cor3_co_0: của cái việc\n00:19:59: 2-cor3_co_0: sử dụng cái\n00:20:01: 2-cor3_co_0: mình sẽ làm cái lm có sẵn để giải quyết vấn đề\n00:20:06: 2-cor3_co_0: Vấn đề là nó sẽ đơn giản như là mình không cần maintain cái lm này\n00:20:11: 2-cor3_co_0: nhưng mà mình sẽ kiểu tốn tiền, càng ngày càng tốn tiền cho nó\n00:20:15: 2-cor3_co_0: Thành ra mấy ngày này nó tính theo kiểu tiền của tôi này\n00:20:21: 2-cor3_co_0: Giả sử thằng quỷ GPD4 này, sải nhiều user chắc trả tiền mất nghị luôn\n00:20:28: 2-cor3_co_0: Còn cái khác là cái self-LM thì nó trade-off việc là mình sẽ phải tự maintain cái LM của mình\n00:20:36: 2-cor3_co_0: Tự build server, rồi tự rom ra, rồi load balance, rồi import gì đó, v.v.\n00:20:44: 2-cor3_co_0: Nguyên cái đóng này, rồi ngồi mình tự optimize, tự build server, rồi consider nó\n00:20:51: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó sẽ dựa vào những cái, đa số nó sẽ dựa vào những cái model kiểu outsource\n00:20:58: 2-cor3_co_0: để làm á\n00:21:01: 2-cor3_co_0: thì chắc là mình sẽ tự build nó như này\n00:21:03: 2-cor3_co_0: như này là mình build những cái model mình có sẵn trên thị trường\n00:21:06: 2-cor3_co_0: để đa tiếp lội sẵn trên thị trường để mình làm\n00:21:10: 2-cor3_co_0: ý này là cái vấn đề trade-off\n00:21:15: 2-cor3_co_0: sử dụng cho mất cứ software nào\n00:21:18: 2-cor3_co_0: chẳng có gì\n00:21:21: 2-cor3_co_0: Trong quá trình này thì cái mà có vẻ mới mẻ và mọi người thấy consider để mà tốt bằng tích của đồ là cái quá trình Evaluate Caperarm\n00:21:42: 2-cor3_co_0: Hôm bữa mình mới tìm hiểu văn này thì tụi nó cũng khá nhiều thứ trong đây\n00:21:48: 2-cor3_co_0: Những cái về cái Actors Evaluate Model nó có\n00:21:53: 2-cor3_co_0: Nó có những cái rule, những cái matrix mà mình cần phải\n00:21:57: 2-cor3_co_0: Khi mình cần phải biết khi mình evaluate một cái prompt á\n00:22:03: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì cái quá trình mà evaluating cái prompt này nó\n00:22:07: 2-cor3_co_0: Mình nghĩ là đóng vai trò khá quan trọng trong cái process mà\n00:22:11: 2-cor3_co_0: Mình tìm cái model phù hợp và cái prompt phù hợp cho cái sản phẩm của mình\n00:22:17: 2-cor3_co_0: Thì cái quá trình này nó sẽ tốn nhiều effort trong cái nguyên cái project làm cái blog của mình.\n00:22:35: 2-cor3_co_0: Rồi, đó là toàn bộ cái article của thằng...\n00:22:47: 2-cor3_co_0: đang hiểu kiểu là nó sẽ tìm ý là cái chân biết ai đó là nó gồm rất là nhiều thứ lên\n00:23:16: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó đang cần\n00:23:19: 2-cor3_co_0: biết một cái model nào đó\n00:23:22: 2-cor3_co_0: như là MMA\n00:23:23: 2-cor3_co_0: hoặc là cái GPT\n00:23:26: 2-cor3_co_0: hoặc là một cái model\n00:23:27: 2-cor3_co_0: tào lao ở trên thị trường\n00:23:29: 2-cor3_co_0: để nó giải quyết một cái\n00:23:31: 2-cor3_co_0: problem nào đó của tụi nó\n00:23:34: 2-cor3_co_0: giải sử như là tụi nó muốn\n00:23:37: 2-cor3_co_0: làm một cái\n00:23:40: 2-cor3_co_0: software để nó\n00:23:43: 2-cor3_co_0: classify những cái object\n00:23:45: 2-cor3_co_0: hoặc là software để mà nó\n00:23:48: 2-cor3_co_0: detect những cái hình ảnh\n00:23:50: 2-cor3_co_0: những con mèo\n00:23:52: 2-cor3_co_0: con chó gì đó\n00:23:53: 2-cor3_co_0: hoặc là\n00:23:55: 2-cor3_co_0: mấy cái mô đồ để\n00:23:58: 2-cor3_co_0: record hoặc là để\n00:23:59: 2-cor3_co_0: summarize một cái bài báo\n00:24:02: 2-cor3_co_0: chẳng hạn, thì tụi nó cần phải chọn\n00:24:04: 2-cor3_co_0: một mô đồ đó phù hợp nhất cho sản phẩm\n00:24:06: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó sẽ bắt đầu\n00:24:08: 2-cor3_co_0: đặt ra những cái quy trình này\n00:24:09: 2-cor3_co_0: để cái output cuối cùng\n00:24:12: 2-cor3_co_0: của nó, nó sẽ là\n00:24:13: 2-cor3_co_0: Tụi nó sẽ nên xài mô đồ nào\n00:24:15: 2-cor3_co_0: Và cái problem của nó sẽ như thế nào\n00:24:18: 2-cor3_co_0: Để ra được kết quả\n00:24:20: 2-cor3_co_0: Mong muốn\n00:24:21: 2-cor3_co_0: Và giải quyết được vấn đề của nó\n00:24:23: 2-cor3_co_0: Cảm ơn\n00:24:23: 2-cor3_co_0: Cảm ơn\n00:24:30: 3-thanh_pham_0: không chắc đọc nó vậy thì là bên kia đi còn nó sẽ kiểu experiment với những cái\n00:24:36: 2-cor3_co_0: Cảm ơn\n00:24:48: 3-thanh_pham_0: feature như cái áp bé nên qua tính em thì nó đi file ra một ngọn quy trình\n00:24:53: 3-thanh_pham_0: Để đâu đó mà thứ nhất là để xây dựng này sau đó để xem cái output của cái app đấy nó có ok không\n00:25:02: 3-thanh_pham_0: Thì nó giống như trước giờ mình làm thôi nhưng mà may be là kiểu chưa có bước đánh giá cái chấm điểm\n00:25:10: 3-thanh_pham_0: scoring cái cái cái output của cái cái app hay cái model thôi chính xác là của cái model mà của cái\n00:25:13: 2-cor3_co_0: đúng ý là trước giờ em thấy mình làm nha có đây là mình sẽ đi tìm cái mô đồ và mình sẽ mua đồ đó\n00:25:23: 3-thanh_pham_0: Cảm ơn các bạn đã theo dõi và hẹn gặp lại.\n00:25:27: 2-cor3_co_0: rồi mình nghĩ ra cái dư kê thì mình xài của đồ đó nhưng mà cái quy định nể quy trình là tựa\n00:25:33: 2-cor3_co_0: nó để đi file cái đi nó rồi nó đi pha cái dư kê xin lỗi tôi muốn làm cái gì cho sản phẩm rồi và\n00:25:38: 2-cor3_co_0: đi tìm cái mô đồ và cái prompt phù hợp\n00:25:41: 2-cor3_co_0: thì mới xin ra\n00:25:43: 2-cor3_co_0: quá trình này\n00:25:43: 2-cor3_co_0: còn xưa giờ em thấy mình kiểu\n00:25:46: 2-cor3_co_0: đi tìm cái mô đồ chơi thôi mà\n00:25:53: 3-thanh_pham_0: Hẹn gặp lại các bạn trong những video tiếp theo.\n00:26:08: 2-cor3_co_0: Ờ, đúng rồi, kiểu vậy. Tụi nó có thể làm bất cứ gì, tụi nó có thể chọn một cái model có sẵn trên thị trường cũng được nếu mà nó phù hợp.\n00:26:20: 2-cor3_co_0: Còn nếu mà tất cả mọi thứ mà tìm không phù hợp thì cái quy trình này có thể là tụi nó sẽ tự build một cái model luôn, chứ không phải là tụi nó lúc nào cũng xài những cái model quá sẵn trên thị trường.\n00:26:23: 3-thanh_pham_0: là cái điểm chấm điểm là hiện tại nó sẽ có như kiểu một cái một cái mít và đem điểm cho cho\n00:26:46: 3-thanh_pham_0: của mấy cái LEM app, output của model\n00:26:49: 3-thanh_pham_0: thì not sure phải standard hay không\n00:26:53: 3-thanh_pham_0: nhưng mà chúng ta open sort nhiều cái\n00:26:56: 3-thanh_pham_0: dạng Benx, kiểu tạng như thế\n00:26:58: 3-thanh_pham_0: thì cũng hôm trước chưa đọc kỹ là xem\n00:27:01: 3-thanh_pham_0: bọn Discord thì nó đang kiểu refer theo\n00:27:03: 3-thanh_pham_0: một cái quy chuẩn nào\n00:27:05: 3-thanh_pham_0: nhưng mà chắc nó sẽ kiểu như kiểu\n00:27:08: 3-thanh_pham_0: AP testing thôi\n00:27:09: 3-thanh_pham_0: nó pick một cái model, nó test xem là\n00:27:12: 3-thanh_pham_0: cái output nó có match với cả cái recommend hay không\n00:27:14: 3-thanh_pham_0: không có thì chọn 2 hướng\n00:27:17: 3-thanh_pham_0: thứ nhất là chọn model khác\n00:27:18: 3-thanh_pham_0: nó Qualify hơn\n00:27:19: 3-thanh_pham_0: hai là nó sẽ đi kiểu file tuning\n00:27:21: 3-thanh_pham_0: hoặc là implement mấy cái\n00:27:23: 3-thanh_pham_0: technique như kiểu Rack Rack các thứ\n00:27:25: 3-thanh_pham_0: để đảm bảo output\n00:27:26: 3-thanh_pham_0: thì cuối cùng ở đây là kiểm thử xem là\n00:27:29: 3-thanh_pham_0: chạy kiểu iteration thôi\n00:27:32: 3-thanh_pham_0: lúc xem output nó có ok không\n00:27:34: 3-thanh_pham_0: chưa ok thì ta tìm cách ta\n00:27:36: 3-thanh_pham_0: làm cho nó ok hơn\n00:27:38: 2-cor3_co_0: Chịu kìa vậy tại vì bữa trong cái\n00:27:44: 3-thanh_pham_0: Nếu có thích thì nhớ like, share và đăng ký kênh để ủng hộ kênh của mình nhé.\n00:28:02: 2-cor3_co_0: Cái link nữa nó có một cái gọi là\n00:28:05: 2-cor3_co_0: cái này nè\n00:28:09: 2-cor3_co_0: assist evaluation\n00:28:11: 2-cor3_co_0: thì nó là kiểu\n00:28:14: 2-cor3_co_0: quăng một đống from\n00:28:16: 2-cor3_co_0: qua một đống cái model\n00:28:18: 2-cor3_co_0: xong ra một đống cái output\n00:28:20: 2-cor3_co_0: thì sẽ có một thằng\n00:28:22: 2-cor3_co_0: đứng giữa\n00:28:23: 2-cor3_co_0: để validate cái đống output này\n00:28:26: 2-cor3_co_0: cho đọc điểm số nào đó\n00:28:28: 2-cor3_co_0: rồi mình sẽ biết được là\n00:28:30: 2-cor3_co_0: mình nên pick những cái\n00:28:31: 2-cor3_co_0: from nào từ model nào\n00:28:33: 2-cor3_co_0: nó đi ngược, có value rồi đúng không?\n00:28:35: 2-cor3_co_0: có cái đánh giá của thằng model\n00:28:38: 2-cor3_co_0: giả sử thằng chìm\n00:28:40: 2-cor3_co_0: thì 4 nó đánh giá xong rồi\n00:28:42: 2-cor3_co_0: thì mình sẽ đi ngược lại là ok\n00:28:43: 2-cor3_co_0: thằng nào điểm cao nhất, pick nó\n00:28:45: 2-cor3_co_0: rồi pick cái prompt nào cao nhất thì pick ra\n00:28:47: 2-cor3_co_0: để làm cái giải quyết vấn đề của mình thôi\n00:28:57: 2-cor3_co_0: đúng rồi, đúng rồi, đúng rồi\n00:29:03: 2-cor3_co_0: ừ ừ\n00:29:11: 1-baddeed_0: rồi có một cái quy trình mà tụi nó đang sử dụng để đảm bảo các em đạt được mục tiêu cho nó yêu cầu\n00:29:21: 1-baddeed_0: anh em có hỏi cho em không sẵn không có hỏi\n00:29:22: 2-cor3_co_0: cken\n00:29:29: 1-baddeed_0: bài của em 40 phút giảm mạng 3 phút\n00:29:35: 1-baddeed_0: 10 phút\n00:29:41: 1-baddeed_0: ok Nếu không có câu hỏi câu hỏi không em nhanh mình qua\n00:29:50: 1-baddeed_0: cái\n00:29:51: 1-baddeed_0: ok không có hỏi Cảm ơn em Cảm ơn em Cảm ơn tâm rồi rồi Mời các bạn xuống sân khấu các\n</code></pre>\n<p><img
