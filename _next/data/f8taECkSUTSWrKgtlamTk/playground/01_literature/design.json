However, the icon carries multiple meanings and is interpreted in various ways, making it ambiguous.\n\n### Ambiguity\nThe icon lacks a clear definition or consistent meaning.\n    \nFor example, the Spark icon is used in apps like **Plane Finder,** but its meaning varies between apps, leaving users unsure about its exact purpose.\n \n![](assets/2-product-design-commentary-plane-finder.png)\n    \nThe **Ulta & Google Meet** apps face a similar issue where the Sparkle icon leads to confusion. Users struggle to accurately guess the exact meaning or purpose of the icon, as it is unclear. This inconsistency in usage results in misunderstandings about what the icon is supposed to represent in different contexts.\n\n![](assets/2-product-design-commentary-ulta.png)\n    \n![](assets/2-product-design-commentary-google-meet.png)\n    \nThe image presents statistics on how users interpret the Spark icon. The results show that many users associate it with saving favorites, special information, or promotions. This indicates a lack of clarity in the icon design, which is commonly used by many brands today, leading to user confusion.\n    \n### Misuse of the icon\nAs more AI features are introduced, overuse of the Sparkles icon (✨) can increase user confusion, especially since it’s commonly associated with AI-driven functionalities like recommendations and automation.\n\n- The icon is often unclear, leading users to misinterpret its connection to AI.\n- This vagueness highlights the need for **context** and better explanations to ensure users understand its role in representing AI-related features.\n- Without clarity, users may fail to recognize the association between the icon and AI technology.\n        \n![](assets/2-product-design-commentary-figma.png)\n        \n![](assets/2-product-design-commentary-figma-design.png)\n        \n![](assets/2-product-design-commentary-figma-view.png)\n        \n![](assets/2-product-design-commentary-interview.png)\n\n![](assets/2-product-design-commentary-nylas.png)\n        \n### Impact on UX\nWithout proper context (such as tooltips or labels), the Sparkles icon can cause confusion and reduce interface clarity.\n    \n![](assets/2-product-design-commentary-compare.png)\n    \n### Summary & Conclusion\n- The **sparkles icon (✨)** is frequently used to represent AI features, but it often leads to **ambiguity** and **misunderstanding**.\n- Users frequently **misinterpret** the icon, associating it with unrelated functions.\n- Providing **context** and clear explanations is essential for improving its effectiveness.\n- **Consistent and thoughtful usage** of the icon can make it a valuable tool for AI-driven functionality.\n- Design teams should prioritize **clarity and user experience** when using abstract icons in interfaces.\n\n## New AI User Onboarding\nArticle: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/new-AI-users-onboarding/?lm=ai-magic-8-ball&pt=article\n\n### Simplify Onboarding\nA study with 6 participants from China tested AI chatbots like Baidu's Ernie bot, ChatGLM, and SparkDesk. Out of the group, 3 had no prior experience with AI, while others had limited knowledge, thinking AI mainly created images and videos. SparkDesk provided a long tutorial but assumed users already knew how chatbots worked, causing confusion.\n\nIn contrast, US ChatGPT users would ask questions starting with “Can you?” which allowed them to quickly understand the tool’s capabilities. This interaction helped them grasp the tool’s potential more easily.\n\n![](assets/2-product-design-commentary-example.png)\n\n### Use the Tool Name to Indicate Functionality\n**App-store descriptions** are crucial for clarifying a tool’s function. For example, the **EF Hello** app is a **good practice** by using a clear name and tagline that clearly communicates its AI-driven language learning capabilities. In contrast, the **Ernie chatbot** represents a **bad practice** because its unclear name makes it difficult for users to understand the app’s purpose, causing confusion and making it harder for users to remember. Clear, concise descriptions are essential to guide users effectively.\n\n![](assets/2-product-design-commentary-app.png)\n\n### Follow Best Practices for Onboarding Tutorials\nUsers tend to skip lengthy tutorials, so it’s essential to provide **contextual help** based on their current actions. For instance, the **SparkDesk** app offered multiple FAQs but failed to address core questions like \"What does this tool do?\" or \"How does it work?\". Useful tips should appear after users understand the interface, similar to how **Perplexity.ai** uses hover tooltips. Unnecessary onboarding steps, like the **Ernie app**'s character selection, may confuse users by leading them to believe the character’s personality affects the tool’s output, causing misunderstandings about its capabilities\n\n- **Avoid pop-up windows** during onboarding, as users may mistake them for ads and **dismiss them immediately**.\n- Pop-up instructions are often unnecessary if the icons are **self-explanatory** and their functions are clear to users.\n\n![](assets/2-product-design-commentary-application.png)\n\n### Provide General Task Examples Instead of Specific Ones\nNew users often begin with AI chatbots by following provided examples. However, overly specific examples like “Poem with Plum” or “Horoscope Matching” may not resonate with most users. Broader examples like \"Generate text\" or \"Create an image\" are more effective in helping users explore the tool’s capabilities. These general tasks, such as \"Help me study\" or \"Help me debug,\" allow users to naturally discover the AI’s potential, making tools like ChatGPT easier to use and more practical in real-life scenarios. Clear guidance enhances the overall user experience.\n\n![](assets/2-product-design-commentary-example.png)\n\n## Key Takeaways for Designing AI Apps\n- **Simplify Onboarding**: Keep instructions short, answering key questions about the app's function and how users can interact with it.\n- **Contextual Help**: Introduce features gradually as users interact to avoid overwhelming them with too much information.\n- **Broad, Generalized Examples**: Use general examples to demonstrate AI's capabilities, encouraging user exploration.\n- **Clear Communication**: App name, tagline, and store description should clearly convey the product’s function.\n- **Minimize Complexity**: Eliminate unnecessary pop-ups and features to simplify the UX.\n- **Adapt the Experience**: Support users with timely help as they explore the app.\n- **Testing & Feedback**: Test with real users, especially those with limited AI experience, to identify pain points.\n","title":"Product Design Commentary #2: Unpacking the sparkles icon and AI onboarding challenges","short_title":"","description":"In this second edition, we explore the use of the Sparkle (✨) icon for AI-driven features and the common confusion it creates for users.

As we explore the intricate dynamics of AI and its role in enhancing human-computer interaction, it becomes essential to understand the functional and spatial relationships that AI establishes within systems. These relationships directly impact the effectiveness and intuitiveness of user interactions with AI-driven systems.\n\nThis article explores the scope of relationships between Generative AI and other system elements, focusing on three key aspects: **System Scope Relationships**, **Spatial Relationships**, and **Functional Relationships**.\n\n## System scope relationship\nThe first layer in understanding how Generative AI fits into larger systems is to explore the **System Scope Relationships**. This relationship defines the scale at which AI integrates with other elements of a system and plays a crucial role in determining its interaction model. The five categories within system scope are\n\n![](assets/4-product-design-weekly-system-scope-relationships.png)\n\n1. **Component**:\n    - **Example**: AI used to provide additional context or cognitive insight behind individual elements in a system. For instance, a feature that suggests relevant actions for a user in a specific interface component.\n2. **Flow**:\n    - **Example**: AI automates or enhances multi-step flows. A practical example would be a chatbot guiding users through a multi-step process, automatically completing sections based on previous inputs.\n3. **Feature**:\n    - **Example**: Here, AI powers a specific action or feature. Consider an AI-driven grammar checker embedded in a word processor.\n4. **Application**:\n    - **Example**: AI creates entire applications or powers core experiences. For example, tools like Grammarly, which is primarily an AI-driven application built around content refinement and language improvement.\n5. **Platform and Ecosystem**:\n    - **Example**: On a larger scale, platforms or ecosystems use AI pervasively. An ecosystem may see different systems interacting through a network of AI technologies, such as multiple SaaS tools integrated with AI APIs to enhance functionalities and data flow across systems.\n\nEach level of this scope reveals the depth at which AI interacts within a digital system—from individual elements to entire ecosystems. Designers should consider how AI features align with the scale of their product's experience.\n\n## Spatial relationships\nIn terms of user interface (UI) design, **Spatial Relationships** describe the physical layout and placement of AI components relative to other features on a screen. This placement is crucial for ensuring a seamless interaction between AI elements and the rest of the user experience. The diagram highlights the following relationships\n\n![](assets/4-product-design-weekly-system-spatial-relationships.png)\n\n1. **Separate**:\n    - **Description**: Generative AI is placed on a completely different page or space.\n    - **Example**: Think of an AI-driven support system that opens a separate window or app when initiated, like a full-screen chatbot.\n2. **Alongside**:\n    - **Description**: Generative AI is placed on the same screen but in its own space, typically as a side panel.\n    - **Example**: A sidebar AI assistant that provides suggestions while users work in the main content space.\n3. **Layered**:\n    - **Description**: Generative AI exists as a floating modal or overlay.\n    - **Example**: A floating AI chatbot on a shopping website that pops up over the main content area when activated.\n4. **Integrated (Parent and Child)**:\n    - **Description**: AI is intermingled with the feature and drives the content. In the parent relationship, AI takes the primary role, while the child relationship sees the AI supplementing the feature.\n    - **Example**: AI tools that refine user-written text in real-time, such as an AI-driven grammar checker in a text editor.\n5. **Point**:\n    - **Description**: AI supports a specific feature, acting at a particular point in the content.\n    - **Example**: AI-powered auto-suggestions that appear while typing in a search bar, subtly enhancing the primary feature.\n\nThe spatial design directly impacts user navigation and interaction fluidity, and placing AI in the appropriate spatial relationship ensures a seamless user experience.\n\n## Functional relationships\nLastly, **Functional Relationships** refer to how Generative AI interacts with other features and content at a functional level. The interaction model can vary based on the role AI plays within the system. The different types of functional relationships include\n\n![](assets/4-product-design-weekly-system-functional-relationships.png)\n\n1. **Separate**:\n    - **Description**: AI operates in a separate experience without direct interaction with other features.\n    - **Example**: A separate AI content generation tool like MidJourney, which creates art without influencing other features directly.\n2. **Aware of**:\n    - **Description**: Generative AI is aware of other content or features, but it does not act upon them directly.\n    - **Example**: An AI that passively monitors text input and offers suggestions based on the content without actively changing it.\n3. **Acting upon**:\n    - **Description**: Generative AI can directly interact with and modify content or features based on user input.\n    - **Example**: AI-powered content moderation tools that automatically remove inappropriate content in a chatroom.\n4. **Feature incorporates**:\n    - **Description**: AI-generated outputs are integrated into the user experience, enhancing the primary feature.\n    - **Example**: A text editor like Microsoft Word that incorporates AI-generated writing suggestions directly into the content being created.\n5. **Uses feature**:\n    - **Description**: Generative AI relies on other features to function properly.\n    - **Example**: An AI system that relies on database queries to generate relevant reports or suggestions.\n6. **Uses conversationally**:\n    - **Description**: AI interacts with features and the user through conversational inputs and responses, often as a two-way exchange.\n    - **Example**: A conversational AI that interacts with users through voice commands, such as Google Assistant, which processes natural language inputs to perform tasks.\n\nThese functional dynamics define how deeply integrated AI is with system features and user actions, guiding how AI can best support or enhance user experiences.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe evolution of Generative AI within digital systems hinges on its **scope**, **spatial**, and **functional relationships**. Designers and developers must pay close attention to how these relationships manifest within their products to ensure that AI serves to enhance the user experience rather than disrupt it. By understanding how Generative AI fits into these relationships, we can design more intuitive, helpful, and powerful AI-driven experiences that feel natural and effortless for the user.\n\nGenerative AI is a transformative tool, and its success relies on how well it integrates into the systems and experiences we create. As AI technology evolves, designers must constantly rethink these relationships to maintain an optimal balance between functionality and usability.\n","title":"Product Design Commentary #4: Generative AI UX design patterns","short_title":"","description":"This fourth edition looks at how Generative AI fits into digital systems.

While foundational technologies often seem under the purview of data scientists and engineers, designers play a crucial role in bridging the gap between user needs and emerging technologies. This article explores **the role of UX** and **how to determine which user problems are best solved with AI** while assessing their effectiveness.\n\n## Understanding UX in AI-Driven Design\n\n![](assets/6-product-design-weekly-framework.png)\n\nTo develop effective AI-powered applications, it is vital to deeply understand user needs and apply UX principles throughout the design process. Only then can we create AI solutions that truly meet end-user expectations.\n\nConsider a trading platform aiming to implement an AI system to analyze crypto market trends. While some users might find such a feature disruptive to their trading habits and fear potential data breaches, others may over-rely on the system's recommendations—even when those recommendations are flawed. This could lead to severe issues, such as automated trading strategies triggering \"flash crashes,\" where large-scale sell-offs are executed based on negative signals, causing significant losses for both AI users and the broader market.\n\nThis scenario highlights a common challenge in applying AI across industries. It underscores the importance of close collaboration between UX designers, AI developers, and engineers to overcome these obstacles, enhance system efficiency, and foster user acceptance.\n\nMachine learning (ML) is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Misguided applications of ML can result in unintended consequences. Identifying the right problem to address and evaluating whether ML is the most suitable tool is paramount. **While AI and ML can solve complex problems, they cannot independently identify what problems need solving**—a critical role that UX plays in steering the application of technology effectively.\n\n## What’s New When Working with AI?\nWhen designing any product, user-centered decisions are key. Three critical considerations for integrating AI into products are:\n\n### Identifying the Intersection of User Needs and AI Strengths\nDetermine the real-world problems users need to solve and evaluate whether AI offers unique value in addressing these issues. This requires a deep understanding of user needs and AI capabilities to ensure the proposed solution is both practical and valuable.\n\n### Balancing Automation vs. Augmentation\nDecide whether AI should fully automate a task or merely enhance user performance. Automation suits repetitive, mundane, or hazardous tasks, while augmentation is better suited for tasks where users want active involvement and where social or cognitive value is significant.\n\n### Designing and Evaluating Reward Functions\nEvery AI model is guided by a reward function, also called an “objective function” or “loss function.” This is a set of mathematical formulas that define the system's perception of \"correct\" versus \"incorrect\" predictions. Careful design of the reward function ensures long-term benefits and avoids unintended outcomes that might adversely affect user experience.\n\n### Use Case Examples: When AI Works Best vs. When It Doesn't\n\n![](assets/6-product-design-weekly-fit.png)\n\n![](assets/6-product-design-weekly-fall-short.png)\n\n## Where to Integrate AI into Products and Solutions\n### Enhancing Efficiency\nAI can learn user behaviors, identify patterns, and make actionable suggestions to save time and resources. For instance, [**Siri**](https://support.apple.com/en-vn/guide/iphone/iph6f94af287/ios) suggests apps based on daily habits, like opening a fitness tracker at 6 a.m. if the user jogs at that time. Similarly, platforms like Netflix and YouTube recommend content based on viewing history.\n\n![](assets/6-product-design-weekly-siri.png)\n\nAI also enhances logistics efficiency. Delivery services like DHL and FedEx optimize delivery routes, cutting fuel costs by up to 30%. These systems predict optimal paths and times, saving shipping costs and improving delivery speed.\n\n### Reducing Mundane Tasks\nAI is ideal for automating repetitive, low-value tasks. For example, AI tools in Photoshop now automate background removal or complex graphic designs with simple commands, tasks that once required significant manual effort.\n\n![](assets/6-product-design-weekly-mundane-task.png)\n\nIn finance, AI-powered tools consolidate data from various crypto exchanges, [generate weekly portfolio reports](https://medium.com/@batuhansenerr/ai-powered-financial-analysis-multi-agent-systems-transform-data-into-insights-d94e4867d75d), and issue alerts for sudden price changes. These tools enable investors to make informed decisions faster, automating tedious tracking processes.\n\n![](assets/6-product-design-weekly-finance.png)\n\nAutomation, however, isn't always ideal. Some tasks, like journaling or creative work, offer intrinsic value when performed manually. Instead of fully automating such activities, AI can assist by suggesting ideas or providing guidance, enhancing the user’s creative experience without taking over.\n\n### Supporting User Tasks\nAI can act as a powerful assistant, helping users achieve goals seamlessly. Financial apps like **Acorns** and **Wealthfront** use AI to help users manage savings, track progress toward milestones like homeownership, and adjust strategies based on personal financial data.\n\n![](assets/6-product-design-weekly-wealth-front.png)\n\nAI can also help your users accomplish tasks that were previously impossible or difficult to access.\n\n![](assets/6-product-design-weekly-notion.png)\n\nGrammarly and Notion AI assist users in writing tasks, ranging from crafting marketing content to editing documents. These AI tools help correct grammar mistakes, suggest better phrasing, and even provide content ideas. They enable users, even those who aren't writing experts, to create professional-quality pieces, saving time and enhancing the overall quality of their output.\n\n![](assets/6-product-design-weekly-grammarly.png)\n\nSimilarly, [Duolingo](https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/) incorporates gamification into language learning through daily and weekly challenges. These challenges are tailored to match the learner's current proficiency level, helping them progress while maintaining an effective and engaging learning routine.\n\n### Improving Safety and Health\nAI enhances user safety through real-time data processing. Apple devices analyze user movements to detect falls, automatically contacting emergency services if necessary.\n\n![](assets/6-product-design-weekly-health.png)\n\nIn healthcare, AI systems like DeepMind's retinal disease detection analyze medical images to [diagnose conditions](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/using-ai-to-predict-retinal-disease-progression/) early. With accuracy rivaling specialists, such tools empower healthcare providers to deliver faster, more reliable care.\n\n![](assets/6-product-design-weekly-deep-mind.png)\n*AI system for predicting exAMD. Predictions from the raw and segmented retina scans are combined to calculate the risk of AMD progression within 6 months.*\n\n## Conclusion\nAI is not a silver bullet for every problem. As designers, our ultimate goal is to solve user challenges and help them achieve their objectives. By understanding their needs and developing comprehensive solutions, we can identify where AI best fits to amplify outcomes. Start with the problem, then let AI elevate the solution.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n- A chapter from Google's guide on [User Needs + Defining Success (Responsible AI)](https://pair.withgoogle.com/chapter/user-needs/), focusing on understanding and meeting user needs during the development of AI systems.\n\n- The article [\"Applications Of Machine Learning For Designers\"](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/applications-machine-learning-designers/) on Smashing Magazine discusses the applications of machine learning for designers, helping them understand how to integrate this technology into their design process.","title":"Product Design Commentary #6: AI in Design - Cool ideas and how to make them happen","short_title":"","description":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings boundless opportunities to enhance both user experience and daily life.

In this model, everyone will have their own version of the internet, shaped by AI interfaces that understand their preferences, goals, and personal context. These smart systems automatically adjust the user interface, showing up when needed and disappearing after completing tasks (called [Ephemeral Web-Based Applications](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ephemeral-web-based-applications/)). This approach creates unique experiences that fit specific use cases.\n\nBy using AI, we can create more personal moments, experiences, and interactions. This level of deep personalization promises to change how we use technology, making our digital experiences better, more efficient, and more suited to our individual needs and preferences.\n\n![](assets/7-product-design-weekly-hyper-personalization.png)\n\n## Hyper-personalization vs. traditional personalization\n\nThe main difference between Hyper-Personalization and basic Personalization is that it **uses many different types of data** to create a complete picture of each user. Basic Personalization only makes suggestions based on groups of users using basic information. On the other hand, Hyper-Personalization focuses on each person with more detailed analysis, using up-to-the-minute data along with AI and data processing. This helps understand users better and predict what they might do next, allowing for a more personal experience across websites, emails, and mobile apps.\n\n| **Criteria** | **Hyper-personalization** | **Traditional personalization** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Level of customization** | Very detailed, uses real-time data, behavior, and specific context for each user. | Based on common traits or basic data like name, gender, or age. |\n| **Data sources** | Real-time data, behavior history, personal preferences, location, current context | Basic user info (age, gender, location), general purchase history. |\n| **Technology** | Smart technology that can learn and predict | Simple if-then rules. |\n| **Key features** | Automatically suggests products/services based on each person's specific behavior and situation. | Shows content or products based on general customer groups. |\n| **Interaction** | Real-time interaction that changes based on what the user is doing right now. | Fixed interaction that doesn't change in real-time. |\n| **Goal** | Make customers happier by better understanding their personal needs and situation. | Make products/services more relevant to target customers. |\n| **Examples** | - Amazon's product suggestions based on what you're searching for right now | - Netflix showing movies based on what you like to watch | - Marketing emails that start with your name | - Product suggestions based on customer groups |\n\n## How hyper-personalization makes things personal\n\nHyper-Personalization works through four main steps:\n\n#### Step 1: Data acquisition and preparation\n\n- **Collecting information:**\n    - **Basic personal info:** Age, gender, location, income\n    - **How people use the product:** Purchase history, habits, time spent on site, items in cart, visits\n    - **Personal preferences:** Likes, interests, feedback\n    - **Current activity:** Recent searches, recent purchases, comments, likes, shares\n    - **Current situation:** Location, time, user status, mood (for example, rapid scrolling or leaving pages quickly may indicate frustration or dissatisfaction)\n- **Cleaning up information:**\n    - Filling in missing information with reasonable values\n    - Finding and fixing incorrect information\n    - Making sure all information is organized in the same way\n- **Creating helpful insights:** Taking existing information and turning it into useful insights for AI\n    - For example: Working out how valuable a customer is or how often they shop\n\n#### Step 2: Choose the right AI method\n\n- **Collaborative filtering (CF)**: Most effective when there is enough data about how users interact with items. Makes recommendations by finding products that similar users have enjoyed.\n- **Content-based filtering (CBF)**: Ideal for systems with detailed product attributes. Recommends items similar to customers' previous purchases.\n- **Hybrid models**: Best suited for addressing cold start problems and enhancing accuracy by combining both customer data and product characteristics to generate more precise recommendations.\n- **Advanced techniques**: Use neural networks and deep reinforcement learning to analyze user behavior patterns, enabling the system to better understand and respond to user needs.\n\n#### Step 3: Train and test the system\n\n- **Split the model training:**\n    - Training Data (70-80%): Used to teach the system.\n    - Testing Data (10-15%): Check how well the system works.\n    - Validation Data (10-15%): Fine-tune the system to avoid mistakes.\n- **Check performance:**\n    - Look at how many people click, buy, or find the suggestions helpful.\n\n#### Step 4: Keep improving\n\n- **A/B testing:** Test different approaches to find what works best.\n- **Model retraining:** Keep the system up to date with new information about how customers behave.\n\n## Practical applications of hyper-personalization\n\n![](assets/7-product-design-weekly-personalization.png)\n\n*Source: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leveling-up-personalization-maturity-curve-amir-yazdanpanah)*\n\nHyper-personalization has 3 main real-world uses:\n\n1. **Adaptive content:** It can tailor content to fit each person. This works well for product marketing and especially in education. For example, [Sesame Workshop](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/sesame-workshop-and-ibm-team-up-to-test-a-new-a-i-powered-teaching-method/) tested an AI-powered vocabulary learning app with kindergarten students. The app uses Sesame Street characters in games and videos to help kids learn new words. The AI adjusts lessons based on each student's ability and lets parents and teachers track progress. Students learned better, even with difficult words. This personalized learning approach helps make education more effective, where students of all levels can learn and grow together.\n2. **Personalized recommendations:** Streaming apps like [Spotify](https://sea.mashable.com/tech/34358/spotify-wants-to-make-you-an-ai-playlist-for-every-occasion) and Netflix use AI to suggest songs and movies based on what you watch. Amazon's product suggestions are another good example. Amazon looks at what customers buy, view, and rate to understand what each person likes. This kind of suggestion can work for many services that need to match individual needs. Here are some examples:\n    - Suggesting travel plans and hotels for vacations\n    - Recommending fashion styles based on personal taste\n    - A personal magazine that picks articles you'll enjoy\n    - Custom diet and exercise plans that fit your health needs\n3. **Adaptive user interfaces:** Many apps have too many features that can overwhelm users. [Contextual AI](https://business.adobe.com/blog/perspectives/contextual-ai-the-next-frontier-of-artificial-intelligence) helps by learning how you use the app and showing only the features you need, making it simpler to use. For example, [Siemens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9_U2EI0Sdw)' NX CAD, a 3D design software used in architecture and engineering, uses AI to learn from users and predict what commands they might need next. This makes the software easier to use for both new and experienced users.\n\n## Challenges around hyper-personalization\n\n1. **Privacy:** Since AI learns from user data, privacy is a major concern. The key is to be open with users. Always ask for permission before collecting data, clearly explain what data you want to collect, how you plan to use it, and how you'll protect it. Make it easy for users to delete their personal information if they want to.\n2. **Bias:** Social media apps often show users only what they already like or agree with. This can make people less open to different viewpoints. To reduce this problem, make sure to use diverse data when training the AI. If you're using data from users, consider having a way to review content. Keep checking your product's AI to make sure it's fair to everyone.\n3. **Fatigue:** Seeing the same kind of content over and over can get boring. People's interests change over time, and AI based on past behavior can't always predict when someone wants something new. To fix this, let users reset their preferences or control how personalized their experience is. For example, a music app might suggest a random song that's different from what the user usually likes, just to offer something fresh.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBeyond learning and health applications, we can use personalization in finance. For example, creating personalized financial dashboards that only show portfolio and transactions that matter to users. Or suggesting the best times to pay bills and save money based on spending habits.\n\nWhile personalization paints a perfect picture, it's not without problems. Users can get bored seeing the same things, content can be one-sided, and there are data privacy risks. That's why it's important to keep focusing on what users need - research, design, test, and improve - to solve these issues and make sure your product succeeds.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n- An article on UX Design discussing how [generative AI](https://uxdesign.cc/transforming-ux-with-generative-ai-7b06ea329286) is transforming user experience\n- A technical deep dive on LinkedIn about [building AI models](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-ai-models-hyper-personalization-technical-deep-deepak-gupta-tohuc/) for hyper-personalization","title":"Product Design Commentary #7: Hyper-personalization - How AI improves user experience personalization","short_title":"","description":"Hyper-personalization represents the future of product development, delivering personalized experiences that adapt to each user's needs.
