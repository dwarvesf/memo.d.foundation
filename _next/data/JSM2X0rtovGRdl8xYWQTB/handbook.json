run Dwarves as an open company/community.\n\nDwarves Community is melting pot for software engineers, thinkers, learners and techies who are to explore, learn and master the latest advancements in technology.\n\nTechnology is moving at the speed of light, and we want to stay at the forefront. Background or experience doesn’t matter to us, we are more keen on the mindset of always being curious about what’s next in tech, collaborating for the better, learning profusely and sharing unconditionally.\n\n- [ICY](community/icy.md)\n- [Memo](community/memo.md)\n- [Discord](community/discord.md)\n- [Radar](community/radar.md)\n- [Earn](community/earn.md)\n\n## How our community started\n\nWe believe great software comes from working together. Many consulting firms keep knowledge inside their walls. We wanted to try something new. Could we keep clients happy while creating a space for learning and sharing? This led us to create the [Dwarves Network](https://discord.com/invite/dwarvesv), a community that goes beyond our team to include coders, students, and tech lovers who share our passion for good work.\n\nDiscord became our main hub. We set up channels for work and public talks where anyone can join tech discussions. We changed company meetings into community events. Our team all-hands meetings became Monthly Community Calls, where team members and community folks share updates and ideas.\n\nWe added radio talks in Discord's stage channels for casual sharing. To thank people for helping, we created [ICY](https://icy.so), our blockchain token that rewards good contributions from anyone, whether they work for us or not.\n\nThis setup grew through trying things out. Now it's a big part of who we are. We call ourselves an open learning network for tech people, which fits what we've become: a consulting company with a open learning community around it.\n\n## How our community runs\n\nThe Dwarves Network works on a few simple ideas:\n\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dwarvesv) is our main space, with channels set up for different needs. This lets us do focused work while having open tech talks.\n\nWe replaced closed company meetings with open ones. Our Monthly Community Calls and radio talks welcome anyone interested in our work and the tech we use.\n\nTeam members and community folks earn ICY tokens for good contributions on Discord or our [Memo site](https://memo.d.foundation/). This rewards value creation from anyone.\n\nWe call ourselves an open learning network for tech people, showing our focus on sharing knowledge beyond company lines.\n\n## Lesson learned from building community\n\nRunning Dwarves this way has taught us a lot. Here are our main takeaways:\n\n### Fresh ideas flow when given direction\n\nOpening our doors brought in new thinking. Ideas from Discord talks have helped client projects, and community content shows off our shared knowledge. But community talks need a clear purpose. Without direction, conversations can wander. We balance openness with focus, asking: \"How can our community help our consulting work?\"\n\nWe find ways to involve community members in projects through testing or feedback. This creates a cycle where our work informs the community, and community insights improve what we deliver.\n\n### Good communities need care\n\nOur Monthly Community Calls and radio talks build real connections. The ICY token system adds a fun element that keeps people involved. Running a good community takes resources. Watching discussions, planning events, and running the token system take time. We balance this work with our consulting duties.\n\nWe're still figuring out the money side. Should the community make its own income through referrals or paid offerings? Or should it be supported by our consulting work? These questions matter for our future.\n\n### Openness builds trust\n\nBeing an open learning hub has helped our reputation. Clients see us as forward-thinking, and talented people like our sharing culture. We have clear guidelines for sharing that keep the right balance. This helps us maintain a healthy space where both client work and community learning can grow. As we get bigger, we think about how to scale well. Success means keeping clients happy while growing a healthy learning space.\n\n### Smart rewards improve participation\n\nOur ICY token system has sparked many contributions on Discord and our Memo site. People love sharing knowledge when their work gets noticed. We focus on quality over quantity. We've fine-tuned our approach to reward good contributions, not just lots of posts. We also think about ICY's long-term value and how token holders can benefit in ways that match our community goals.\n\n### Our culture makes us special\n\nOur model shows our core values: openness, curiosity, and teamwork. It gives us a unique identity and attracts like-minded people. Keeping this culture gets harder as we grow. New members need good onboarding to understand how we work, and we solve differences thoughtfully to keep our positive vibe. We often ask: What shared values bring our team and community together? How do we welcome newcomers while keeping what makes Dwarves special?\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThe Dwarves Network is still growing. It already brings big benefits: better ideas, stronger ties, and a unique market position. But we're still learning as we go. Our big questions now are: How can the community boost our consulting work? How do we measure success? And how do we explain this model to members who might not be familiar with it?\n\nIf you're part of Dwarves, as an employee or community member, we want your thoughts. What works well? What could be better? Let's build this together. Balancing consulting and community isn't always easy, but it creates something better than either could alone. That's the Dwarves way.\n\n## Our Community Channels\n\n- [Memo](https://memo.d.foundation/) - Our knowledge repository\n- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dwarvesv) - Our main hub for discussions\n- [Github](https://github.com/dwarvesf) - Where we share open source code\n- [Website](https://d.foundation/) - Our official site\n\n---\n\n> Next: [ICY](community/icy.md)\n","title":"Dwarves as a community","short_title":"As a community","description":"How we blend software consulting with an open learning community where tech enthusiasts share knowledge, collaborate, and grow together.","tags":["community","network","handbook"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao"],"date":"Wed Jun 26 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"handbook/as-a-community.md","slugArray":["handbook","as-a-community"]},{"content":"\nSince most Dwarves Foundation employees work in Saigon, this section is written with that as the default. Some benefits don't make sense in other countries. We will try our best to provide comparable benefits and perks as it makes sense, though.\n\n## Team Growth\n\n### Continuing Education Allowance (CEA)\n\nWe encourage you to grow by learning and playing with new technologies. You'll get a yearly budget for your learning and development goals, from books to conferences.\n\nIf you're interested in taking classes that you feel improve you professionally or personally, you have a $300 annual stipend to do so. This benefit is applied to any full-time Dwarf who has been here for more than 6 months.\n\n### Conference\n\nIn the case of conferences, the company will pay 50% of all expenses for approved job-related conferences and seminars. We'll pay 100% of the expenses if you participate as Guest Speaker.\n\nTo get approval to attend a conference, submit a request to the Ops Team. In your request, provide as much detail as possible about the conference dates, your total expected out-of-office time, the costs of attending, the benefits expected to be gained by attending, any potential disruption to client work, etc. We will check on a case-by-case basis.\n\n### Work Supplies Expense\n\nThe company will pay for work-related expenses, such as software or office supplies. If you have any doubts about whether or not to expense something, just ask. Get a receipt when you purchase work supplies. Take a photo of that receipt, and send it along with the request ticket in Basecamp for the reimbursements via the paycheck.\n\n### Project Commission\n\nThe company will pay a commission on revenues it receives from each project which the employee procures. The commission will consist of 5% of the gross revenues for the project. This may be split amongst multiple salespeople. A project does not have to have a salesperson.\n\n### Year-End Gift\n\nAt the end of every year, Dwarves gives a thank-you gift to employees. This gift comes in the form of a cash bonus / or as presents. The bonus is accompanied by a beautiful keepsake that contains ideas & inspiration for how to use your bonus, but ultimately how you spend it or save it is up to you.\n\n### Monday Radio Talk\n\nWe work and grow alongside tech. Besides the daily project work, the team forms different study groups based on mutual tech interests. It is either learning new techniques, discussing trends, creating products or applying practice that benefits in the long run.\nWe host a weekly Monday Radio Talk, where each presenter showcases their learning to the team. After each session, we format the audio file and upload them onto Dwarves Youtube.\n\nWe also reserve a budget to reward the valuable knowledge from the team. The more you contribute, the more bonus you get up to no limits.\n\n## Teammate Support\n\n### Employee Liquidity Pool\n\nIf Dwarves Foundation is ever sold or part of an IPO, tenured employees will be eligible to receive a portion of 5% of the company's value. That 5% would be divided into units, based on the number of employees we have at the time. People at Dwarves Foundation for less than 1 year would receive 0 units, someone employed 1 year would receive 1 unit, and so on, until you're fully vested at 5 years for 5 units.\n\n### Employee Stock Option Plan\n\nYou can own the company if you don't want to be just tenured employees. As part of the package, being a significant contributor will give you the right to buy a certain amount of company shares at a predetermined price. We will discuss this on a case-by-case basis.\n\n### Employee Referral Bonus\n\nWe usually hire, and to keep the quality bar, the Dwarves are encouraged to recommend friends that you think they match with the team. We believe your suggestions should be helpful as you have to know the person.\n\nThe company will pay a referral bonus to any employee who refers an applicant to our company hired by the company to a full-time position. The bonus is only applicable once the applicant successfully becomes a full-time Dwarves and is a part of at least one project.\n\nThe referring employee must still be employed with the company when the bonus is to be given.\n\n### Employee Profit-Sharing\n\nDwarves sometime offer 5 - 10% of its annual company profits with employees, which is distributed in shares based on tenure. Profits are distributed after the books are closed on the previous fiscal year, usually around March.\n\nThis model is eligible to participate after two years of working at Dwarves Foundation. The Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the profit sharing program if you resign or are terminated from Dwarves.\n\n### Paid Time Off\n\nDwarves Foundation offers two weeks of paid vacation, a few extra personal days to use at your discretion, and the official national holidays every year. This is a guideline, so no problem if you need a couple of extra days. We don't track your days off; we use the honor system. Just make sure to check with your team before taking an extended absence so they're not left in the lurch.\n\n### Short-term Disability\n\nOn top of Paid Time Off, the company offers a self-funded short-term disability (STD) plan to all its employees. If you fall ill or injure yourself and cannot work because of it, let us know, and you can take 30 days off at 75% pay. If after that, you're still unable to work, the STD policy kicks in, and you'll continue to earn 50% of your salary until you're better, up to 6 months off. These days are an emergency reserve, in addition to your vacation/sick time described above. If you still cannot work after this period, talk to your manager, and we will discuss what comes next on a case-by-case basis.\n\n### Flight Tickets to Dwarves Hubs\n\nWe encourage our teammates to try out the Dwarves Hubs across the country. Besides the HQ in HCMC, Dwarves Hubs are also located in Da Lat & Da Nang.\n\nWe provide a package of flight ticket 4 times a year, with a maximum amount of 2.000.000 VND for each travel time. With a borderless software firm, we believe that giving people the flexibility to try out the work hubs and visit their teammates is a must.\n\n### Annual Healthcare\n\nWe do have Bao Minh insurance, but we wish to provide more healthcare services beyond that. This annual healthcare supports the Dwarves with a healthcare package of 5.000.000VND, takes place annually around February or March, which includes:\n\n- Overall healthcare checkup\n- Cancer screening\n- Female & Male healthcare\n- Ear, nose & throat\n- Blood & urine examination (sample test will be taken at our office)\n\nIf you request further checkup, a 5-25% discount will be applied for full-time employees.\n\n### Parental Leave\n\nWhen you welcome a new child, we encourage you to take up to 6 months leave for primary caregivers not more than 2 months before giving birth. The father is allowed up to 5 days of leave as a secondary caregiver. And if you have twins, you can take up to 10 fully paid days off. All parental leaves are at 100% base salary.\n\nThese benefits only applied for full-time Dwarves who have been on-boarded for more than 6 months in advance of pregnancy (internship and probation period are omitted).\n","title":"Benefits & perks","short_title":"","description":"Since most Dwarves Foundation employees work in Saigon, this section is written with that as the default.

Ours aims to be different. From the start, we designed it as a space *for developers*, prioritizing genuine connection and knowledge sharing over corporate speak. We operate it as a blend of company and community because we believe that's the most valuable approach.\n\nSo, what actually happens here?\n\n* **We share knowledge:** We discuss software insights through seminars, casual channel chats, and tech talks. If it's about development, it's welcome.\n* **We connect with people:** This is our virtual space to hang out with friends, alumni, and like-minded developers. No forced networking.\n* **We build in the open:** We're creating a software network people genuinely want to join. Discord is central to that effort.\n\nWe recently reorganized the channels to hopefully make navigation and connection easier. Here's a breakdown:\n\n## Where stuff happens: the channels\n\nChannels fall into two main categories: common areas for everyone and spaces more focused on our internal consulting work.\n\n### Community hangouts (everyone welcome)\n\n* **off-topic:** For general, non-work conversations.\n  * `⛺・random`: The place for memes, weekend stories, pet pictures, and anything else off-topic.\n  * `📈・trading-cafe`: Discussions about markets, crypto, and trading.\n* **research:** The hub for technical discussions.\n  * `🌟・starboard`: Notable messages highlighted by the community land here.\n  * `💡・til`: Share your \"today I learned\" moments, big or small.\n  * `💻・tech`: General technology discussions, news, and questions.\n  * `🎒・topics`: Focused discussions on specific technical subjects.\n\n### Internal & ops channels (mostly for staff & mods)\n\n* **project:** Discussions related to active client projects (primarily for our consulting team).\n* **consulting:** The main area for internal team communication.\n  * `🏢・lobby`: General company-wide announcements and discussions.\n  * `🦄・pink-alert`: For urgent matters needing immediate attention.\n* **moderation:** Keeping the community running smoothly.\n  * `🗣・community`: Coordination for community initiatives.\n  * `🎗️・operation`: Server management and administrative tasks.\n* **misc & log:** Essential background channels.\n  * `🤖・bot-commands`: Interacting with server bots.\n  * `🧊・icy-log`: Automated server activity logs.\n\n## Who's who: Discord roles\n\nWe needed a role system that reflects contribution and expertise as we grow, not just arbitrary labels. Our system combines ladder-based roles (earned through participation) and function-based roles (based on responsibilities).\n\nWhy this structure? We want to recognize engagement and skill, eventually linking roles to tangible benefits like NFTs and `$icy` staking (more details soon). It's about creating a system that rewards active participation.\n\n![Dwarves Network Discord Role Structure](assets/discord-role-structure.webp)\n\n### The core MMA roles (mastery, meaning, autonomy)\n\nThis system recognizes different types of impact:\n\n* **@labs (mastery):** Your technical skill is recognized and valued by the community.\n* **@sers (meaning):** You make meaningful contributions, through quality work or positive community involvement.\n* **@chad (autonomy):** You consistently deliver high-quality work effectively and reliably.\n\n### Keeping the lights on (moderation)\n\n* **supporter:** Welcomes new members and helps with daily questions.\n* **moderator:** Organizes events, facilitates discussions, and may host talks.\n* **smod:** Oversees major community and operational functions.\n\n### Community crew\n\n* **guest:** The starting role for everyone.\n* **newbie:** Granted after basic introductions. Welcome aboard!\n* **frens:** Actively participates in public channels.\n* **contributor:** Helps bring new, valuable members into the community.\n* **trustee:** A recognized and trusted voice within the community.\n\n### Consulting staff (our internal team structure)\n\n* **apprentice:** Team members new to Dwarves.\n* **baby dwarf:** Developing their focus within the team.\n* **dwarf:** Actively participates in R&D and learning.\n* **crafter:** Consistently delivers quality software.\n* **specialist:** Possesses deep expertise in a specific domain.\n* **principle:** Helps maintain and elevate the team's standards.\n* **elite:** Guides the team's technical direction.\n\n### Functional roles (what people focus on)\n\nThese roles represent key operational areas:\n\n* **engagement:** Aligns the team around vision and values.\n* **learning:** Promotes continuous skill development.\n* **partnership:** Focuses on client relationships and project acquisition.\n* **communication:** Ensures transparent information flow.\n* **delivery:** Oversees the quality and shipment of work.\n\n## Our helpful bots\n\nBeing developers, we've built bots to automate tasks and add useful features:\n\n* **Mochi:** A tipping bot using `$MOCHI`. Use `!tip` to give a virtual high-five for helpful answers or contributions.\n* **Tono:** Our primary server management bot, handling roles and background tasks.\n* **Fortress:** An internal tool for tracking performance and issues (less community-facing).\n\n## How do I level up? (the `$icy` system)\n\nWe use our custom token, [`$icy`](icy.md), as the server's primary internal currency – think of it as community points.\n\nYou earn `$icy` through activity and contributions. Higher engagement leads to more `$icy`, which helps you climb the role ladder.\n\nAchieving certain roles will also eventually grant a boosting NFT, providing tangible value back to our most active members.\n\nThat covers the basics! Feel free to jump into a channel and introduce yourself.\n\nSee you [on the server!](http://discord.gg/dwarvesv)\n\n---\n\n> Next: [Earn](earn.md)\n","title":"Dwarves Network Discord","short_title":"Discord","description":"Our Discord isn't just another company server; it's a place for both our team and the wider developer community.

Bounties often involve work outside a developer's primary skillset, offering a chance to learn and contribute in new ways.\n\n### Who can participate?\n\nOur bounty program provides opportunities for developers looking for interesting challenges and a way to connect with others.\n\n* The program is open to anyone with the necessary skills for a specific bounty.\n* Common skills needed include writing, design, research, development, and finance analysis.\n\n### How it works\n\nFirst, join our Discord server. If you haven't already, say hello in the `😀・arrival` channel.\n\n1. **Check the bounty board:** Visit <earn.d.foundation> to see available tasks.\n2. **Claim a bounty:** Select a bounty you want to work on and claim it by opening a ticket in the `⁠🎫・support-ticket` channel on Discord.\n3. **Deliver the work & get paid:** Complete the bounty requirements. Once your contribution (usually a Pull Request on GitHub) is approved and merged, you'll receive your $ICY reward.\n\n### Rewards\n\nWe allocate a monthly pool of **1700 $ICY** (roughly equivalent to $2,500 USD, though the value fluctuates) for the bounty system.\n\nYou can use your earned **$ICY** to redeem exclusive Dwarves swag or swap it for USDC.\n\nPlease note: Rewards are paid out *after* the corresponding Pull Request (PR) is accepted and merged into the relevant Dwarves GitHub repository.

We've made the process simple and secure. Let's walk through it together.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore you begin, you'll need two things: a Bitcoin (BTC) wallet to receive your funds and some ETH on the Base network for gas fees. Don't have a BTC wallet? No problem! You can set one up using trusted providers like Electrum, Trust Wallet, or UniSat. If you need help with ETH for gas fees, just reach out to our team on the Dwarves Foundation Discord—we're here to help!\n\n## Step 1: Connect to icy.so\n\nFirst, visit [icy.so](https://icy.so) and click \"Connect Wallet\" to select your preferred wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.). Follow the connection prompts, and make sure you're on the **Base network**.\n\n![Connect wallet interface showing the wallet connection button and network selection](assets/icy-swap-connect-wallet.png)\n\n## Step 2: Make the swap\n\nOnce connected, you'll need to select **ICY** as your source token and **BTC** as your destination token. Enter the amount you want to swap (remember, the minimum is `20 ICY`), input your **BTC wallet address**, and click \"Swap\". You'll need to confirm the transaction in your wallet.\n\n![Animated demonstration of the swap process on icy.so](assets/icy-swap-process.gif)\n\n## Step 3: Track your transaction\n\nAfter confirming, you can watch your transaction in the \"Recent Transactions\" section. Hover over the transaction to see details, including the service fee. Wait for the \"Pending\" status to complete.\n\n![Transaction tracking interface showing pending status and service fee details](assets/icy-swap-transaction-status.png)\n\nProcessing time varies based on network conditions, gas fees paid, and system load. Don't worry if it takes some time—we ensure 100% of transactions are processed.\n\n## Important details to remember\n\nKeep these key points in mind when swapping your ICY:\n\n- The minimum swap amount is `20 ICY`\n- Each transaction has a service fee of `3,000 units`\n- Gas fees are paid in ETH on the Base network\n- Processing may be delayed during high network activity\n\nNeed help?

We've moved from a fixed USDC-backed system to a dynamic Bitcoin-backed model. This change brings new opportunities and considerations for ICY holders. Let's break down what this means for you.\n\n![How much icy worth](assets/how-much-is-your-icy-worth.png)\n\n## The old model: Simple and stable\n\nPreviously, ICY had a straightforward value proposition. Each ICY was worth exactly `1.5 USDC`, and this value remained constant regardless of market conditions. This made it easy to understand and trade, providing stability and predictability for our community.\n\n## The new model: Dynamic and Bitcoin-backed\n\nNow, ICY's value is tied to Bitcoin (BTC) through our liquidity pools. We manage two separate pools—one for ICY and one for BTC—and the interaction between these pools determines ICY's value. The initial conversion rate is set at a predetermined ratio, but the value will fluctuate based on BTC's price and pool dynamics.\n\n### What this means for you\n\nYour ICY's value now depends on three main factors:\n\n- Bitcoin's current market price\n- Liquidity pool conditions\n- Overall market demand for ICY\n\nLet's look at how these factors work together.\n\nWhen we add BTC to the pool, it makes ICY more valuable because each ICY is backed by more Bitcoin. Conversely, when we add more ICY to the pool, it reduces the value because each ICY is backed by less Bitcoin.\n\n### Real-world examples\n\nLet's look at how this plays out in practice.\nLet's say we start with `1 ICY` being worth `0.00003 BTC`. If Bitcoin is trading at `$50,000`, your ICY would be worth `$1.50`. If Bitcoin's price rises to `$60,000`, your ICY would increase in value to `$1.80`.\n\nNow, let's see how liquidity affects the value. Starting with the same setup (`1 ICY = 0.00003 BTC` at `$50,000`), if we add more BTC to the pool, the ratio might shift to `1 ICY = 0.000035 BTC`, increasing your ICY's value to `$1.75`. On the other hand, if we add more ICY to the pool, the ratio might shift to `1 ICY = 0.000025 BTC`, decreasing your ICY's value to `$1.25`.\n\n### How we manage liquidity\n\nWe follow a structured approach to maintain the pools. We add Bitcoin monthly at market prices, and we mint ICY weekly for company activities and rewards. This regular management helps ensure stability while allowing for market-driven value changes.\n\n## Why we made this change\n\nWhile the USDC model was simple and effective, we believe in evolving with the crypto ecosystem. This new model offers several advantages: it provides growth potential tied to Bitcoin's performance, reduces our dependency on stablecoins, creates a more dynamic and market-driven system, and better reflects real-world trading conditions.\n\nThe value of your ICY will now fluctuate based on market conditions. We recommend staying informed about Bitcoin's performance and liquidity pool dynamics to make informed decisions about your ICY holdings.\n","title":"How much is your ICY worth","short_title":"","description":"Learn how ICY's value has evolved from a fixed USDC-backed model to a dynamic Bitcoin-backed system.

We just happen to have *lots* of them – tales of building teams, surviving milestones, how we live, how we work. We share these stories, our learnings, and pretty much everything else on [Dwarves Memo](https://memo.d.foundation). Think of it as pulling back the curtain so you can understand us better.\n\n## What's memo all about?\n\nFundamentally, Memo is our **public learning engine**. It's where we capture the 1% improvements, the experiments, the hard-won lessons. Written by Dwarves, for product craftsmen (and anyone curious).\n\nYou'll find:\n\n* **Team research & deep dives:** Notes on new tech, case studies, technical blogs.\n* **Company stuff:** Updates, year-end recaps, how we operate.\n* **Culture bits:** Our values, facts, figures, what makes us tick.\n* **Podcast transcripts:** Notes from webinars and interviews.\n* **Playbooks & handbooks:** Like this very page!\n\nBasically, if it's documented and worth sharing, it probably lives on Memo.\n\n## Why we do it this way\n\nMemo is central to how we share knowledge and attract like-minded folks. If you want the business jargon, you could call it our \"inbound strategy.\" We're not big on pushy outbound sales or marketing. We prefer being a \"calm company,\" giving our team space to explore, experiment, and figure out the next big thing.\n\nThe valuable stuff that comes out of that work? It lands on Memo.\n\n## The content pipeline\n\nHow does stuff actually get published? It looks something like this:\n\n![Content Pipeline](assets/content-pipeline.png)\n\n1. **News & curiosity:** We learn something new, work on a project, or just get curious.\n2. **Question & answer:** We explore it, document findings, answer the questions that arise.\n3. **Content calendar & echo:** The refined \"answer\" gets scheduled by our comms team and published (echoed!) on Memo and other channels.\n\nOur comms team helps polish and schedule posts, making sure things look good before they go live.\n\n## How to contribute\n\nPlease do! Memo is built on Markdown files stored directly in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dwarvesf/memo.d.foundation) (the same one that powers the site via GitHub Pages). Getting your thoughts published is pretty straightforward:\n\n1. **Create or edit a markdown file:** Find the right spot within the `vault/` directory structure (e.g., `vault/engineering/`, `vault/culture/`). Create a new `.md` file or edit an existing one.\n2. **Add frontmatter:** This YAML metadata at the *very top* of your file is crucial for the site generator. Include at least these fields:\n    * `title`: The main title for your post.\n    * `description`: A short, tweet-length summary of your post.\n    * `tags`: Relevant keywords (e.g., `blog`, `engineering`, `react`, `case-study`). `handbook` and `memo` are good general tags.\n    * `author`: Your GitHub username or identifier used in the system (e.g., `tieubao`).\n    * `date`: `YYYY-MM-DD`.\n3. **Formatting:**\n    * Use standard Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`). Keep it simple – `###` should generally be the deepest level. Use **bold** for emphasis if needed, not smaller headings.\n    * Keep paragraphs relatively short and focused. Use lists, images, and code blocks where helpful.\n4. **Submit a pull request:** Commit your changes and open a PR against the main branch of the repository. Once reviewed and merged, GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild the site, and your post will appear on [memo.d.foundation](https://memo.d.foundation).\n\n## Content elevation\n\nWe loosely follow a Zettelkasten-like idea. Quick notes or initial findings might start as simple Markdown files or drafts within the repository (perhaps in a personal fork or a specific drafts area). As ideas mature and become more robust, they get refined, given proper frontmatter, and moved into the main `vault/` structure to become official Memo posts via the PR process.\n\nWe genuinely encourage everyone to contribute. Your voice, your experiences – that's what makes Memo valuable. Nothing reveals who we are better than the people living it every day.\n","title":"Memo Handbook","short_title":"Memo","description":"Memo is where we share everything we learn, build, and think about product craftsmanship, engineering, and our culture.

We share frequently through public events, many of which are recorded for wider learning. While sharing extensively might seem unusual, we believe it offers significant benefits.\n\nThe primary goal isn't just disseminating information; it's about enhancing the presenter's ability to communicate clearly and deepen their own understanding. Teaching others forces you to solidify your knowledge.\n\nIt's common to find skilled programmers who struggle to teach effectively. This often stems from a lack of practice in either teaching or learning from others. When you share, you must articulate your understanding, revealing both strengths and areas needing improvement. Feedback sessions, where others offer constructive criticism, are valuable. They highlight where explanations are unclear and help you strengthen those areas.\n\nThis cycle of sharing and feedback is how we collectively learn and grow.\n\n## Sharing guidelines\n\nWhen preparing to share, keep these guidelines in mind:\n\n* **Scope:** Choose a focused topic rather than something overly broad. This keeps the audience engaged.\n* **Time:** Aim for presentations under 60 minutes.\n* **Language:** Use English for slides to reach a wider audience.\n* **Preparation:** Discuss your topic with a manager or senior team members beforehand. They can offer valuable perspectives.\n* **Structure:** A good presentation typically covers:\n  * The problem being addressed.\n  * How the problem can be solved.\n  * The recommended solution or best practice.\n  * Key mechanisms, techniques, or relevant code.\n  * Pros and cons of the approach.\n  * References for further learning.\n* **Template:** Please use the official [Dwarves presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14n3DFDkroCTWx3y3GutLc8Ous3RWgza9_gi784tGmMo) for your slides.\n\n---\n\n> Next: [Showcase](showcase.md)\n","title":"Sharing knowledge","short_title":"","description":"Sharing knowledge and skills is core to our culture.

This is where teams share what they've been building and learning. While it started with engineering, anyone from any team (design, product, etc.) is welcome to present.\n\nSharing our work is important at Dwarves. Showcases are how we celebrate craftsmanship, share insights, and learn from each other. It's also a great way for those not directly involved in development to see the progress and feel included.\n\n## What makes a good demo?\n\nWe aim for demos that are short, interesting, and easy to understand, not lengthy, formal presentations.\n\nDemos should walk the team through recently completed work or work in progress. This can include new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, new tooling, integrations, prototypes, or refactors. Keep demos concise, around **5-10 minutes**, and generally include:\n\n* A brief description: What is it? Why does it matter? Who benefits?\n* A working example: Show how it works in practice, not just a code walkthrough.\n* Before and after: If it's an improvement, show the difference.\n* Next steps: Briefly mention what might come next.\n\nSharing bug fixes, performance boosts, or internal tooling improvements is highly encouraged. Prototypes and design mocks are also great showcase material. We value seeing all stages of the process.\n\n## Some ground rules\n\nTo keep the showcase positive and focused:\n\n* **No shaming:** We encourage sharing, regardless of how polished the work is. This is a supportive space to learn from colleagues.\n* **No PowerPoint:** Showcases are for demonstrating builds and progress, not presenting slideshows.\n* **No selling:** Demos are for understanding and sharing progress, not sales pitches. What you see is often work in progress and might change.\n* **No blaming:** Respect the work that came before. Focus on the progress and learnings, not fault-finding.\n\n## Come and join us\n\nWe encourage everyone to participate in the showcase. Coordinating with your team is a good way to prepare.

We aim to build a flat and transparent organization where everything runs around the mission. The Ops team takes care of hiring and training their team members.\n\nWe only have an admin to take care of the paperwork. If you have any question, you can ask your team lead or the admin.\n\n**How about the working hours?**\n\nWe care about the quality of the work we produce rather than the number of hours worked.

All employees have a quota for medical check-ups based on specific categories.\n\n### Basic conditions for receiving the Bao Minh Health Insurance card for full-time employees\n\n- Passed probation\n- Do not require the company to pay Social Insurance (SI) and Health Insurance (HI).\n- Be one of the core members of the DF team, voted as an outstanding employee of the previous year, or a top contributor to the team's advocacy & learning activities.\n\n- *Note: Some members have SI and HI still receive the Bao Minh insurance card due to needing extra coverage or as a reward for their contributions. These cases are handled individually, and the team may consider publicizing this policy to motivate employees.*\n\nStarting in 2023, the team switched to using Bao Minh virtual cards for easier use and information storage.\n\n**How will the insurance card be received?**\n\n- The Ops team will email the virtual insurance cards to each eligible person.\n- For those who register for their family members, Bao Minh will send the electronic cards to the company email along with the personal card.\n\n**How to use the Bao Minh virtual card?**\n\n- When visiting a hospital, or clinic during the insurance company's working hours, present the virtual card along with your Citizen Identity Card (CCCD) or National Identity Card (CMND) at the affiliated hospitals.\n- The healthcare facility will check and deduct the medical costs directly from the service bill. Employees only need to pay the difference (if any), and there is no need to submit reimbursement documents for advances.\n- If you visit a hospital, or clinic outside the insurance company's working hours, you will need to pay for the services upfront and then submit the required documentation to the healthcare provider for reimbursement.\n\n**How can I submit an insurance claim?**\n\n- The online claim process is posted here: [Online Claims](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/HZKduaMQSiwrMMac9nvUGak9) and [Claim Process](http://boithuong.baominh.com.vn/).\n\n- Details about the Bao Minh Insurance program for 2024 can be found here: [Bao Minh Insurance 2024](https://3.basecamp.com/4108948/buckets/9403032/messages/7244105315).\n\n### Medical fee guarantee hours\n\n- Medical fee guarantee: From 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM, Monday to Saturday, and Sunday from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM.\n- Medical check-ups at the listed facilities affiliated with Bao Minh will be coordinated according to the above hours, at a minimum, from Monday to Saturday.\n- Each insurance clinic in the list has a note because the insurance department of each facility operates according to different hours that match the insurance partners.\n\n**Who should I contact for questions about insurance policies or claims?**\n\n- For any questions related to insurance policies or detailed Q&A about coverage for specific medical treatments, contact Ms. Linh at 0903.914.748 (Zalo) for more information.\n\n- If you have any questions about how to claim insurance (online and offline), the Bao Minh personnel in charge of your file and support Q&A can be found in the 2023 message here: [Bao Minh Support](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/HZKduaMQSiwrMMac9nvUGak9).\n\n## Finance Operations\n\n### Payroll\n\n**Which date will we receive the salary/paycheck/allowance?** \\\nYou get the paycheck on the 1st or the 15th of the month depend on your joined day.\n\n**Can we use another application rather than Wise to receive payroll?** \\\nYes, you can use other banking services as long as it has USD account details.\n\n**What should I do when the payroll date passed for several days, but I didn't receive a payslip?** \\\nIf the payroll date passed for several days and you haven't received payment, open a support ticket in the Discord channel and the ops team will contact you shortly.\n\n**Can I receive payroll in USDT?** \\\nYes, but we do not encourage you to do it. Because the team's liquidity is limited, we will approve case by case to support employees receiving the payslip.\n\n### Wise\n\nWise is a digital banking service that allows users to set up accounts to send and receive funds in different currencies. We use Wise as a salary payment method, therefore, every employee is required to open a Wise account to receive a payslip.\n\n**How to activate Wise balance?**\n\n- Follow the instructions on [Wise.com](http://Wise.com)\n- Deposit $20 into your account to activate the balance\n- If your bank account or visa card is not accepted by Wise, please open a support ticket, and the team will help you to complete the required deposit.\n\n**When will I receive the payslip from Wise?** \\\nSometimes Wise proceeds transactions randomly to make sure they are clean, so it may take 3-4 days for the payslip to reach your account.\n\nIf after 7 days from the payroll date you haven't received any notification from Wise, please open a support ticket so then the ops team can investigate further into the matter further.\n\n## Project Operations\n\n### General questions\n\n**Any interesting projects that we are working on?** \\\nI suppose you can go to [Fortress](fortd.foundation) to view all of that information and if you want to join any of them, you can ask the team lead.\n\n**How about my career path?** \\\nYou can check up the [Making a Career](making-a-career.md) section where we've mapped our trajectory of mastery to *six different levels*.\n\n**What are we heading to this month?** \\\nPlanning is guessing. It's why we don't really have a business plan. However, we do have an all-hands meeting every months that you can join and get updated.\n\n**Can I work on my friend project?** \\\nWe have a short note on this topic [Moonlighting](moonlighting.md).\n\n**Where can I copy the email signature?** \\\nWe build a small web app for it: [sign.d.foundation](https://sign.d.foundation).\n\n**How to raise an issue?** \\\nDepend on the particular circumstances, you can follow the section [Raising an Issue](how-we-work.md#raising-an-issue) or just post a pitch to Basecamp.\n\nWe also have the anonymous feedback form for those who're shy. Check the Woodland HQ message board.\n\n#### Project Bonus\n\nEssentially, anyone participating in project consulting will receive a bonus. If certain projects have extra bonuses for the team, there will be an announcement beforehand on a case-by-case basis. Bonuses are calculated and allocated based on the customer's billing.\n\n**When will the project bonus be received?**\n\n  Project bonuses are received monthly after the client has paid the bill.\n\n**How is it calculated?**\n\n  The bonus from the client is evenly distributed among all members participating in the project, including the account manager, project manager (PM), and delivery manager (DM).\n\n**What is the responsibility of the Project Lead?**\n\nIf the lead receives a bonus but other team members do not, it's because the lead has extra responsibilities and a bigger role in the project's success.\n\nThe lead manages the project, makes key decisions, and ensures goals are met, which justifies the additional pay. The team might review and share the bonus policy for transparency and motivation.\n\n**What are the criteria for receiving an account/project bonus?**\n\nTo receive an account or project bonus, you must:\n\n- Actively participate in the project.\n- Contribute to the project's success.\n- Fulfill specific roles such as account manager, project manager, or delivery manager.\n\nBonuses are based on your impact on the project and how much you contribute to its goals.\n\n#### Refferal bonus\n\n**My friend who I referred to the company has already completed her probation period and finished her first month with the company. Why have I not received my referral bonus?**\n\nOur goal is to ensure that projects meet our quality standards. We may ask an engineer to join a project as a supporter at first, in order to learn the ropes under his or her mentor/lead.\n\nAs soon as the engineer is ready to work on his or her own, we'll convert him or her into a full-time team member and begin charging clients for his or her billable hours.

Starting at Dwarves Foundation mixes excitement with challenges. You're learning a new job, meeting new colleagues, and adapting to our remote culture, all at once. It's a lot to take in, but we're here to help you navigate this journey.\n\nDifferent roles come with different expectations. Your first step should be getting familiar with [who does what](who-does-what.md) to understand our team structure. During your orientation, we'll clarify what we expect from you during your probation period. If anything seems unclear, don't hesitate to reach out to your Ops buddy or manager, questions are always welcome.\n\nWorking remotely is both a privilege and a responsibility. Make sure you understand [how we work](how-we-work.md) after your orientation meeting. Remember, your Dwarves buddy, Ops buddy, and manager are all ready to support you. While there's no rigid timeline for getting up to speed, most Dwarves find their rhythm within about two months.\n\n## Getting set up\n\nWhen you join, your manager will create a Basecamp space called \"Welcome, [your name]!\" to guide your onboarding. There, you'll find to-dos for accounts you need to set up, like 1Password and enabling 2FA for various services. You'll also see tasks assigned to your Ops buddy or manager for setting up essential tools like Basecamp, email, and GitHub access.\n\nYour onboarding checklist includes:\n\n- [ ] Submit your information\n- [ ] Attend the orientation meeting\n- [ ] Learn who does what\n- [ ] Understand how we work\n- [ ] Set up your devices\n- [ ] Sign up for [services](tools-and-systems.md)\n- [ ] Receive the Dwarves Handbook\n\n### Essential accounts to set up\n\n- [ ] Discord\n- [ ] GitHub\n- [ ] Memo\n- [ ] Email\n- [ ] Basecamp\n- [ ] Fortress\n\n![Dwarves team onboarding](assets/team-welcome.webp)\n\n## Your first probation period\n\nDuring your first probation period, focus on two primary goals: becoming job-ready and building relationships with your teammates.\n\n### Becoming job-ready\n\nThe interview process was just the beginning, now it's time to demonstrate your capabilities in action. Your first two weeks might feel relatively smooth as you're getting oriented. The following six weeks will be more demanding, as we challenge you to show how you think and work.\n\nWe conduct review checks every two weeks to assess your progress and how you're integrating with the team. These check-ins are your opportunity to raise questions about the work or the team, helping us adjust course if needed.\n\n### Building team relationships\n\nUnderstanding our culture is essential to working effectively with your colleagues:\n\n- Take time to learn and adapt to how the team operates, our Culture section is a valuable resource.\n- Reading Remote & Rework will give you helpful context about our working philosophy.\n- Since we work remotely, being active in our team Campfire channel helps others get to know you.\n- We enjoy discussions about technology, software practices, design principles, and occasionally sharing internet humor.\n- Small talk is fine in moderation, but substance matters most.\n- At Dwarves, respect comes from competence and self-management. We value people who are strong in their fields and can manage their own work effectively.\n\n## Connecting with your peers\n\nIn a traditional office, it's obvious who does what. In a remote company, these boundaries can blur. Even when you understand [who does what](who-does-what.md), having a work buddy to reach out to when you're uncertain is invaluable. That's why we've established the [Fortress](https://fortress.d.foundation) system.\n\n## Finding your purpose\n\nCongratulations on making it through your first probation period! While clearing this milestone secures your position, truly joining our team requires something deeper, finding your purpose within our mission.\n\nWe founded Dwarves with a clear vision: to power innovation and co-create the future. We believe software will remain an essential part of that future, which is why we focus on exceptional software delivery, new tech products, and their potential impact.\n\nBuilding an innovation engine where new ideas flourish requires dedicated people committed to the long game. We work tirelessly toward this goal, which is why we seek teammates who share our vision, DNA, and energy.\n\nThe most fulfilled Dwarves discover their personal purpose within our collective mission. They find meaning in crafting exceptional software, solving challenging problems, and creating tools that empower others. Those who don't connect with a sense of purpose typically don't thrive here.\n\n![Finding purpose in work](assets/purpose-quote.webp)\n\nAs you move forward, ask yourself: How does your work contribute to our shared vision? What impact do you want to make? Where do your talents and passions intersect with our goals? Finding these answers transforms a job into a calling.\n\n---\n> Next: [You are Dwarves Foundation](dwarves-foundation-is-you.md)\n","title":"💎 Getting started","short_title":"","description":"From day one to finding your purpose, your journey with Dwarves Foundation starts here.","tags":["handbook","onboarding"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao"],"date":"Thu Feb 21 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"handbook/getting-started.md","slugArray":["handbook","getting-started"]},{"content":"\n## Asset Request\n\nCompany assets equips us to get the job done.

Configure the SMTP server\n\nThis step tells Gmail how to send emails using Google's servers.\n\n1. **SMTP Server:** Enter `smtp.gmail.com`.\n2. **Port:** Keep the default (usually 587 for TLS).\n3. **Username:** Enter your **full personal Gmail address** (e.g., `your.personal.email@gmail.com`).\n4. **Password:** Paste the **16-character App Password** you generated in Step 2.\n5. Leave **Secured connection using TLS** selected.\n6. Click **Add Account »**.\n\n![Gmail SMTP settings popup](assets/email-smtp-settings.gif)\n\n## 6. Confirm ownership\n\nGmail needs to verify you own the `@d.foundation` address.\n\n1. Check your **personal Gmail inbox**. You'll receive an email from Gmail with a confirmation code.\n2. Copy the code from the email.\n3. Paste the code into the popup window and click **Verify**.\n\n## 7. Send emails from your alias\n\nYou're all set! Now when you compose a new email in Gmail, you'll see a \"From\" dropdown menu. You can select your `@d.foundation` address to send from that alias.\n\n* **Tip:** In Gmail's \"Accounts and Import\" settings, you can choose whether to default to replying from the same address the message was sent to, or always reply from your default (personal) address.\n\n## 8. Send from Mac Mail (Optional)\n\nIf you use the Mail app on macOS and want to send from your alias there:\n\n1. Open the **Mail** app.\n2. Go to **Mail** -> **Settings...** (or **Preferences...** on older macOS).\n3. Click the **Accounts** tab.\n4. Select your personal Gmail account from the list on the left.\n5. Click the **Server Settings** tab (or similar, depending on macOS version).\n6. In the \"Outgoing Mail Account\" (SMTP) section, you might need to edit the server list or add the alias directly. *Alternatively, and often simpler:* Click the **Account Information** tab.\n7. Find the **Email Address** dropdown menu and click **Edit Email Addresses...**.\n8. Click the **+** button.\n9. Enter your **Name** and your full `@d.foundation` **Email Address**.\n10. Click **OK**.\n\n![Mac Mail edit email addresses option](assets/email-mac-edit-aliases.webp)\n\n![Mac Mail add alias popup](assets/email-mac-add-alias.webp)\n\nNow, when composing a new message in Mac Mail, you can select your `@d.foundation` alias from the \"From\" dropdown.\n\n![Mac Mail select alias in From field](assets/email-mac-select-alias.webp)\n","title":"Configure your company email","short_title":"","description":"A step-by-step guide to setting up your @d.foundation email alias to send and receive mail directly within your personal Gmail account.","tags":["handbook","email","guide"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao"],"date":"Tue Nov 29 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"handbook/guides/configure-the-company-email.md","slugArray":["handbook","guides","configure-the-company-email"]},{"content":"\nYou will always grow by learning and playing with new and cool technologies.

Make sure to notify everyone involved. For all-hands meetings, use the main Woodlands Basecamp.\n* **External meetings (with clients, etc.):** Use Basecamp as above, but **also send a Google Calendar invite** to include external folks.\n\n### Start on time\n\nSimple but crucial: **Meetings start promptly.**\n\n* If you're leading, it's your job to kick things off on time.\n* If you're attending, be ready to join on time.\n\n### Meet during regular hours\n\nWe aim for **core meeting hours between 10 am and 4 pm**. Please be available during this window for meetings scheduled **at least 24 hours in advance**.\n\nNeed to meet outside these hours? The organizer should schedule it **at least a week ahead**.\n\n### Offer a video option (usually)\n\nVideo helps connection, especially with remote team members:\n\n* **Hosting with remote attendees?** Provide a video link (e.g., Google Meet) before the meeting starts.\n* **Attending remotely?** Join the video call *before* the start time. Ensure you have a **quiet space and a solid internet connection**. Joining by phone audio only or from a noisy public place isn't ideal.\n* **Voice-only sometimes okay?** Yes, if the organizer decides it's sufficient for that specific meeting.\n\n### Responsibilities in the meeting\n\nMeetings are a team effort:\n\n* **Contribute:** Everyone should feel empowered to share ideas and solutions.\n* **Speak up:** If you disagree, raise your point during the meeting so it can be discussed and resolved. Once a decision is made, we all commit to following through. We don't go off-script after agreeing.\n\n### Basics for successful meetings\n\nThese are essential, especially for remote collaboration:\n\n* **Good internet:** A fast, reliable connection is key. Remote folks should minimize potential lag.\n* **Quiet space:** Find somewhere you can focus and hear clearly. If meeting rooms are limited and you're near others not in the meeting, please respect the ongoing discussion – avoid interrupting or side conversations.\n\nMake sure you have these basics covered if you plan to meet or pair program with teammates.\n","title":"Effective meetings","short_title":"","description":"To make working together flexible and productive, we follow a few simple rules for meetings and group work.

Every manager has a 1-on-1 with each direct report, usually weekly or whenever works best for both. This guide explains how we approach 1-on-1s at Dwarves Foundation and offers tips to keep them productive.\n\n## Your first meeting\n\nThink of your first 1-on-1 as **setting the stage**. It's a chance for you and your manager to align on how you'll work together effectively. We like using [Lara Hogan's questions for a first 1-on-1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/) as a starting point for discussion.\n\n**Important:** When scheduling, make it clear this isn't just a project status update. Some folks might be new to 1-on-1s and appreciate the clarification.\n\n## Agenda, notes, and actions\n\nProductive chats start with a plan. If you're the mentee, **this meeting is primarily for you**, so take the lead on drafting an outline of what you want to discuss. Managers can add items too, but your topics should come first.\n\n**After the meeting:**\n\n* Jot down notes on what you covered.\n* List any action items you both committed to.\n* Review these notes and actions next time to track progress.\n\n## In the meeting\n\nFocus on **listening and understanding**. If you're the manager, encourage your reports to be open about what's working and what isn't. Create a space where they feel comfortable sharing honestly, rather than telling you what they think you want to hear.\n\nShift the mindset from a *formal meeting* to a *conversation*. This usually leads to much better outcomes.\n\n## What to discuss\n\nYou can cover a lot in a 1-on-1. Here are some common areas:\n\n* **Big picture:** Ask questions about company direction or changes. Understanding the broader context helps you contribute effectively and feel invested.\n* **Feedback:** Regular feedback is key to growth. Discuss performance, expectations, and standards. Knowing where you stand helps you improve.\n* **Career:** Talk about your growth. Discuss skills you want to build, new areas you'd like to explore, or roles you aspire to.\n* **Personal:** Building connection is important. It's okay to chat about non-work things sometimes – a good book, a recent trip – to get to know each other better.\n\n## Time and schedule\n\nFrequency and length can vary.\n\n* **Good default:** Weekly, 30 minutes.\n* **Try not to:** Go longer than two weeks between meetings. Relationships need regular connection.\n\nOnce scheduled, **treat it as a priority**. Rescheduling occasionally is okay, but cancelling sends the wrong message. **Don't cancel your 1-on-1s.**\n","title":"1-on-1 meetings","short_title":"","description":"Strong relationships are core to our culture, and 1-on-1 meetings are how we build them.

We're looking for teammates who will grow with us for the long term, which is why we place such high importance on finding people who align with our values and culture.\n\nWe don't hire people to tell them what to do. Instead, we hire people who can tell us what to do. This distinction is crucial. We want independent thinkers who can shape their work and contribute to our direction, not just follow orders. This approach helps us maintain our creative culture and build a team of engaged, motivated professionals.\n\n## Our hiring goals\n\nWe seek teammates who embody our core personas: independence, teamwork, problem-solving mindset, and determination. These qualities aren't just nice-to-haves, they're essential to how we function as a team.\n\nIndependence means you can drive your own work. Teamwork means you can collaborate effectively. A problem-solving mindset means you approach challenges creatively. And determination means you persist through difficulties. When we find people who demonstrate these qualities, we know we've found someone who can thrive with us.\n\n## We hire managers of one\n\nWhat does \"manager of one\" mean? It's someone who sets their own goals and executes them without needing constant direction. They don't require daily check-ins or extensive oversight. They essentially do what a manager would do, establish priorities, determine what needs to get done, and follow through, but they do it for themselves.\n\nThese self-directed people free the team from excessive supervision. When left to their own devices, they surprise you with their productivity and initiative. They need minimal handholding because they naturally take ownership of their work.\n\nHow do we identify these people? We look at their history. Have they shown self-sufficiency in previous roles? Have they defined their own path? Have they started a project, company, or initiative from scratch? We look for evidence of initiative and entrepreneurial spirit, then nurture those qualities.\n\nWe want teammates capable of building something from nothing and seeing it through to completion. Finding these people allows our team to focus more on creating and less on managing.\n\n## Our hiring process\n\nWe've designed a thoughtful process to identify the right teammates. Several Dwarves participate in each hiring decision, walking candidates through five distinct stages:\n\n### CV screening\n\nWe start by evaluating your resume and checking references to understand your background and whether you might be a personality fit. Based on our current team composition, we'll decide whether to proceed to the next stage.\n\n### Pre-assessment\n\nFor Fresher and Junior positions, we conduct a 30-minute online test to evaluate logical thinking, English proficiency, and personality traits.\n\n### Assignment\n\nThis stage assesses your skills and problem-solving approach through practical work. It gives us both an opportunity to discuss work-related topics in depth and see how you approach real challenges.\n\n### Interview\n\nDuring our 90-minute interview, you'll learn about our working style and philosophy, while we learn about your background and skills. After this conversation, you'll meet with our Technical Recruiter to discuss the benefits package and clarify expectations from both sides.\n\n### Roadmap design\n\nOnce you've passed the technical assessment, we'll walk you through our vision and long-term plans. This helps ensure we're aligned for the future and creates a foundation for your experience with Dwarves Foundation.\n\n## Alternative entry paths\n\nWe offer two additional programs that run twice yearly in Spring and Summer:\n\n**The Internship**: A 3-month program for students from top universities, with or without engineering backgrounds.\n\n**The Apprenticeship**: A 6-month paid career development program designed for people from underrepresented groups in tech who have non-traditional technical backgrounds.\n\nThese programs give candidates real-world project experience, no coffee runs. We enjoy watching talented people explore and develop their skills in a supportive environment.\n\n![Dwarves internship program](assets/internship.webp)\n\n## Our referral program\n\nWe maintain our quality standards by encouraging Dwarves to recommend friends who would be a good match for our team. Your suggestions are valuable because you know both the person and our culture.\n\nWe prefer to reward you rather than pay external recruiters. When your referral successfully joins as a full-time team member and gets assigned to a project, you'll receive 2% of the project service fee. This bonus is paid when the client completes the project invoice, provided you're still with the company.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n- You refer your friend to Dwarves Foundation\n- Your friend works on a project with a monthly service fee of $5,000\n- Each time the client pays their monthly invoice, you receive a referral bonus of $100\n\nThis approach helps us find great people through our trusted network while rewarding team members who help us grow.\n","title":"How we hire","short_title":"","description":"Hiring means we need help.

This section expands on that foundation, highlighting the key aspects of our work philosophy without repeating information available elsewhere.\n\n## Embracing agile principles\n\nWe build software through collaboration among team members who understand the domain and project vision. This shared understanding helps us adapt quickly to market changes. We embrace agile philosophy at its core, focusing on the principles rather than rigid practices.\n\nThe Scrum framework fits us well. When starting a project, we don't assign specific roles. Each team member has both autonomy and responsibility to meet sprint goals. The Scrum master emerges naturally from within the team as a coach who removes obstacles. This role is temporary; a mature team eventually outgrows the need for a permanent coach.\n\n## Our 8-week cycles\n\nWe organize our work in 8-week cycles, typically running six cycles per year. This fixed timeframe creates a healthy sense of urgency, prevents scope creep, and provides regular intervals to reassess priorities.\n\nThe goal isn't to fit everything within eight weeks. Rather, we break larger projects into manageable chunks that can be completed in this timeframe. We bundle smaller tasks into cohesive work packages that can be clearly discussed and evaluated.\n\nThink of time constraints as a budget that focuses our conversations about what's reasonable. When a project starts slipping, we first look to reduce scope rather than extend hours. Most of our work can be successfully structured within these eight-week boundaries.\n\n## Cooldown periods\n\nBetween cycles, we take a week to cool down. This is when we address backlogs, fix bugs, document completed work, and plan our next priorities. It's tempting to use this time to extend the previous cycle, but we resist that impulse.\n\nWe treat the end of a normal cycle as \"pencils down\" time. By week 4, we should be winding down, preparing to launch, arranging quality assurance, and handling other post-launch activities.\n\n## Meeting structure\n\nAll our scheduled meetings appear on Basecamp. Here are the key gatherings that structure our work:\n\n### All-hands meetings\n\nWe hold all-hands meetings at the end of each cycle. The entire team reviews what we've accomplished and determines our next priorities.\n\n### Team meetings\n\nYou'll belong to one of our functional teams: Programming, Design, Operations, or Business. Each team meets on the last Friday of the month. Team leads may adjust meeting frequency based on specific needs.\n\n### Project meetings\n\nEach project follows its own meeting schedule, aligned with our cycle and Scrum framework. At minimum, each project includes Sprint Planning and Sprint Retrospective meetings.\n\n## Communication approach\n\nFollowing every activity in Basecamp can be overwhelming and unproductive. Instead, we've developed four primary ways to keep everyone informed:\n\n1. **Daily updates**: The \"What did you work on today?\" question provides detailed, personal narratives about ongoing work. These updates spark conversations about topics you care about or want to learn from. While not required daily, please respond at least twice weekly when you're working.\n\n2. **Weekly intentions**: The \"What will you be working on this week?\" question outlines your plans for the coming week. Everyone should answer this when they're not out of office.\n\n3. **Heartbeats**: These team summaries answer \"What did you work on this cycle?\" They celebrate accomplishments and synthesize completed work. Team leads write or assign someone to write these summaries one week after a cycle ends.\n\n4. **Kickoffs**: These team plans address \"What are you going to work on next cycle?\" They outline the coming eight weeks of work. Team leads write or assign someone to write these before each new cycle begins.\n\nThese communication practices allow individuals and teams to work with confidence and independence. We have six major decision points yearly to determine priorities, with the remaining time focused on execution. Clear communication expectations build trust in our direction and process.\n\n## Pitching ideas\n\nEveryone can help shape what we work on, regardless of their role. The way to influence our direction is through pitches.\n\nDevelop your idea for a new feature, workflow improvement, or any product development as a detailed post. The more specific, the better. This gives everyone a chance to consider and respond. Having your idea captured in writing means it's available for reference anytime.\n\nWe always have more pitches than we can pursue, so maintain realistic expectations about what happens after you share yours. At minimum, everyone involved in product development will read and consider your pitch. That alone is valuable. Even if your complete idea isn't implemented, it may influence other decisions by highlighting areas needing attention.\n\nHan and An evaluate pitches for inclusion in upcoming cycles before each cycle begins.\n\n## Raising concerns\n\nOccasionally, team members may have concerns about colleagues, clients, leadership, or the work environment. We want everyone to feel empowered to raise issues and have them addressed promptly and fairly.\n\nHere's how to approach concerns:\n\n1. **Direct conversation**: If you feel comfortable, speak directly with the person involved. We encourage this direct, informal approach and expect colleagues to respond constructively. This works particularly well for communication issues where someone may not realize their behavior is causing distress.\n\n2. **Ask for intervention**: If direct conversation isn't appropriate, ask a colleague or leader to intervene informally on your behalf. This is especially helpful when you're uncomfortable approaching someone directly.\n\nIf you have concerns about a leader and don't feel comfortable raising them directly, speak with another leader or ask a colleague to raise the issue for you.\n\nIf these approaches don't resolve the issue, please speak with Han.\n\n## Our check-in approach\n\n\"Seen any good movies lately?\" \"What's something that inspired you recently?\" \"Found any new recipes worth trying?\" Our check-in questions vary widely and are meant to foster natural connection.\n\nDon't feel obligated to answer every question we pose. None of us do. We prefer organic engagement, so don't be surprised if you see a question without immediate responses, or responses appearing out of sequence. That's perfectly normal and part of our authentic communication style.\n\n## Valuing self-management\n\nAt Dwarves, management is a part-time role that complements hands-on work. We rely heavily on each person's ability to self-manage. Those who excel at this become what we call \"managers of one,\" and we aim for everyone at senior level or above to embody this quality.\n\nWhat does being a manager of one mean in practice? It means setting your own direction when none is given. It means identifying what needs to be done and doing it without waiting for instructions. When left to their own devices, effective self-managers use their time productively. There's always more work to tackle, more initiatives to launch, more improvements to make.\n\n## Remote-first approach\n\nWe deeply value work-life balance and have embraced remote work as our primary operating model. This approach is optional but highly recommended.\n\nWhy? Happy people deliver significantly better results. Creativity suffers when you're confined to the same space day after day. We believe everyone should control their time and work environment as long as they uphold our company values.\n\nWe don't want to manage your physical presence. We want our team to have the freedom to wake up at the beach, grab coffee, and start doing work they love. Or to spend the day in a downtown café for social interaction. Or to breathe fresh air in Da Lat or Chiang Mai, or create a cozy workspace at home with their children nearby.\n\nWith this freedom comes substantial responsibility. Our remote culture works because we trust each team member to deliver the technical expertise our clients expect.\n\n![Remote work at Dwarves](assets/remote-work.webp)\n\n## Project onboarding\n\nWe work on diverse projects at Dwarves. During onboarding, we ensure new team members understand the project type, whether it's a [Ventures](https://dwarves.ventures/) project, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative, or typical Tech Partner engagement.\n\nEach project type carries specific expectations regarding milestone understanding, deliverables, and quality standards. We take craftsmanship seriously, encouraging everyone to take pride in every line of code and every deliverable they produce.\n\n## Our craftsmanship philosophy\n\nSoftware Craftsmanship represents our commitment to responsibility, professionalism, pragmatism, and pride in software development.\n\nWhile craftsmanship alone doesn't guarantee a project's success, its absence is often the primary cause of failure. We strive to embody this philosophy in everything we build.\n\n---\n\n> Next: [Work routine](routine.md)\n","title":"How we work","short_title":"","description":"We organize our work in 8-week cycles with a focus on autonomy and craftsmanship.

While we're primarily a remote-first company, we recognize the value of in-person collaboration. Our hybrid working model gives you flexibility while ensuring we maintain our strong team culture.\n\n## Working remotely\n\nRemote work is at the core of our culture. We trust you to manage your time and deliver excellent work, regardless of where you're located. Whether you're at home, a coffee shop, or halfway around the world, we focus on your contributions, not your location.\n\nSome guidelines for successful remote work:\n\n- Maintain a consistent presence on our communication platforms\n- Keep your calendar updated with your working hours\n- Communicate proactively when you're not available\n- Set up a dedicated workspace that allows you to focus\n\nRemember that with remote work comes responsibility. We expect you to be responsive during your working hours and to deliver high-quality work consistently.\n\n## Office presence\n\nWhile remote work is our default, our offices provide valuable spaces for collaboration, socializing, and building relationships. We encourage you to visit the office when:\n\n- You need dedicated time with your team for collaborative work\n- You're onboarding as a new team member\n- You want to socialize with colleagues\n- You need a change of environment from your usual workspace\n\nEach team determines its own office schedule based on its specific needs. Your team lead will communicate expectations for office attendance, which typically ranges from 1-2 days per week.\n\n## Balancing flexibility and connection\n\nThe key to successful hybrid work is finding the right balance between individual flexibility and team cohesion. Here's how we maintain this balance:\n\n- **Team alignment days**: Each team designates specific days when members come to the office together\n- **Virtual social events**: Regular online gatherings help remote team members stay connected\n- **Quarterly gatherings**: We bring the whole company together at least once per quarter\n- **Clear documentation**: We document decisions and discussions to keep everyone in the loop\n\n## Tools for effective hybrid work\n\nTo support our hybrid model, we rely on several key tools:\n\n- **Basecamp**: Our primary platform for project management and communication\n- **Google Workspace**: For collaborative documents and calendar management\n- **Zoom**: For virtual meetings when we can't be together in person\n- **Slack**: For quick, real-time communication and social interaction\n\nMake sure you're comfortable with these tools and reach out if you need additional training.\n\n## Measuring success\n\nIn a hybrid environment, we measure success by results, not hours spent at a desk. We focus on:\n\n- Meeting project milestones and deadlines\n- Quality of work produced\n- Collaboration with team members\n- Responsiveness during working hours\n- Contribution to team culture and knowledge sharing\n\nYour team lead will provide regular feedback on these aspects during your one-on-one meetings.\n\n## Evolving our approach\n\nOur hybrid model continues to evolve as we learn what works best for our team. We welcome your feedback on how we can improve our approach. Share your thoughts with your team lead or during our quarterly surveys.\n\nRemember, the goal of our hybrid model is to give you the flexibility to do your best work while maintaining the connections that make Dwarves Foundation a great place to work.\n\n---\n\n> Next: [What we stand for](what-we-stand-for.md)\n","title":"Hybrid Working","short_title":"","description":"How we balance remote and office work at Dwarves","tags":["handbook","remote"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao"],"date":"Mon Sep 19 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"handbook/hybrid-working.md","slugArray":["handbook","hybrid-working"]},{"content":"\n## What is this knowledge base thing?\n\nBasically, think of the knowledge base as our team's shared memory, or a \"second brain.\" It's the main spot where we keep all the info and notes we need for our work. We made this so we can work together better, make smarter choices, and stop repeating the same work. It's just our record of how we do things and what we learn along the way.\n\n![knowledge base](assets/knowledge-base.png)\n\n## What kind of stuff is in here?\n\nIt holds two kinds of info:\n\n1. **Private stuff:** This is our internal info, like team details, notes on projects, client info, sales leads, money stuff, and reports. We keep this private because it's important for running the company day-to-day.\n2. **Public stuff:** We also collect useful info that's out there for anyone to see. This could be about what's happening in our field, new tech, who's hiring, interesting articles, or what competitors are up to. Looking at this helps us see the bigger picture and spot chances.\n\nAlso, important chats and decisions from **Basecamp** and **Discord** get added here too, so good ideas don't get lost.\n\n## How do we actually use it?\n\nIt's not just a pile of files; it helps us work smarter. We build tools using this info so you can easily:\n\n* Find answers about how we do things or company policies.\n* Look up past projects or check reports.\n* See what's new in our industry.\n\nThink of it like this: it's our team's collective know-how. As we keep working and learning, this place grows with us. It shows we're serious about getting better at what we do.\n\n## Keeping it useful\n\nMaking sure this knowledge base stays useful takes work. The core team looks after how it's organized and kept up, trying to keep things simple. But it really works best when everyone chips in. We hope you'll add to it, fix things that are out of date, and share ideas to make it better. Keeping our shared brain sharp is something we all do together, showing we care about doing good work.\n","title":"Our second brain","short_title":"Knowledge base","description":"This page explains our knowledge base, which is basically our team's shared brain where we keep important stuff.

A year here, a year there. It's often treated like collecting stamps. We think that's a missed opportunity. At Dwarves, the average tenure is around three years (as of late 2018), and frankly, we want it to be longer. The goal? Make it completely feasible for you to build a *life-long career* here, mastering your craft without being forced into \"management\" just to feel like you're progressing.\n\n## Mastery over management\n\nAdvancing here doesn't mean you have to stop doing the work you love. Whether you're slinging code, crafting designs, managing ops, or supporting users, you level up by getting *better* at that specific thing.\n\nWe're a small company, pretty flat hierarchy-wise (just executives and team heads, who mostly do hands-on work too). So, we needed a clear way to recognize skill progression. We landed on **six mastery levels**. The titles are consistent across departments, but what it *takes* to reach each level obviously differs. Here's the structure for programming, just as an example:\n\n* Fresh Programmer\n* Junior Programmer\n* Programmer\n* Senior Programmer\n* Lead Programmer\n* Principal Programmer\n\n**Important:** This isn't some corporate ladder everyone *must* climb from bottom to top. We need great people at *all* levels. And reaching Principal? That could be a decade-long journey, easily. It's about recognizing deep expertise.\n\nAlso, these titles are about your role *at Dwarves*. You might have been a \"Senior Wizard\" somewhere else, but titles here reflect the mastery you demonstrate *doing work with us*. Day-to-day, titles aren't a huge deal, but they help everyone understand where people are in their journey here.\n\n## The ladder\n\nEspecially in engineering, career paths can feel vague. \"Just keep coding\"? That's not helpful. We saw people leave good jobs elsewhere simply because they felt stuck, unsure of how to grow. And honestly, you can't scale a company or build great things if your best people don't see a future.\n\nThat \"flat structure\" thing many startups boast about? Often just means nobody talks about levels until someone quits. We prefer transparency.\n\nSo, we built [this engineering ladder](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oT2u-cZ4u7ls-V3abmBiddjaZgGTUXBncycxVkyg4Jg/edit#gid=0). It's not about adding bureaucracy; it's about creating a map. It helps *you* see potential paths and helps managers have *meaningful* conversations about your growth, not just hand-wavy ones. It also keeps us consistent when hiring.\n\n### How the ladder works\n\nIt breaks down into a few key parts:\n\n1. **Engineering aspects:** What we value. These aren't just buzzwords; they tie into our [core values]().\n    * **Technical:** Your craft. Mastery, best practices, quality, design, debugging, performance, etc. Can you build solid stuff?\n    * **Execution:** Getting things done. Planning, scoping, estimating, problem-solving, ownership, understanding the 'why' behind the work.\n    * **Influence:** Your impact on others. Leadership (at any level!), sharing knowledge, mentoring, helping hire and onboard.\n    * **Collaboration & communication:** Teamwork. Clear communication (written and verbal), giving/receiving feedback, working well with others.\n\n    > We think of Technical & Execution as **value-adders** (your direct output). Influence & Collaboration are **value-multipliers** (lifting the whole team). As you progress, those multiplier aspects become way more important.\n\n2. **Career paths:** There's more than one way forward.\n    * **Individual contributor (IC) track:** Deepen your craft. Early levels focus on solid execution; senior levels involve more mentoring and guiding others.\n    * **Manager track:** For those who want to lead teams. This is a *technical* management role – you need to understand the work, not just manage spreadsheets. You're a multiplier, focused on unlocking your team's potential.\n\nThe ladder doc has the nitty-gritty details for each level and track. The goal is clarity – know what's expected, see how to grow.\n\n## Salary & promotions\n\nNo secrets here. It's simple:\n\n* **Everyone in the same role at the same level gets paid the same.** Period.\n* **Promotions mean moving up a level.** When that happens, you get a corresponding pay raise, effective March 1st following the January review cycle.\n* **We aim high.** Our payroll fund is tied to 50% of revenue, and we target the top 20% of salary ranges for our industry in Vietnam (using data from market research firms).\n* **Annual review:** We check the market data every January. If rates have gone up, we increase salaries across the board on March 1st to match.\n* **We don't cut pay:** If market rates dip (unlikely, but hey), we hold salaries steady. We don't play games with your compensation.\n\n## Performance reviews\n\nWe do formal reviews twice a year, in **July and January**. Anyone who's been here 90+ days and finished their initial training gets one.\n\nThe point isn't some corporate check-box exercise or ritual judgment. It's about **feedback, recognizing accomplishments, and discussing your career path**.\n\nThe January review wraps up in time for any promotion-related pay adjustments to kick in February 1st (though the standardized market adjustments happen March 1st).\n\nThe process is straightforward:\n\n1. **You write:** A 1-2 page summary of your work, accomplishments, challenges, and thoughts on your growth. Send it to your team lead.\n2. **They review:** Your lead reads your summary, gathers their thoughts (likely chatting with others you work closely with).\n3. **You chat:** You both sit down for an hour to discuss everything.\n\nYour team lead will ping you when it's time. We generally look at things through the lens of [MMA](mma.md). But remember, feedback isn't a twice-a-year event. Ask for it whenever you need it!\n\n---\n\n> Next: [MMA](mma.md)\n","title":"Making a career","short_title":"","description":"Forget the typical tech industry churn.

At Dwarves, we don't track hours or count lines of code. Instead, we focus on three dimensions that together create a complete picture of professional growth: Mastery, Meaning, and Autonomy (MMA).\n\nThis framework helps us evaluate performance while creating a culture where everyone can thrive. It's not about checking boxesit's about understanding and developing the whole professional.\n\n## The three pillars\n\n### Mastery: Your technical journey\n\nMastery is about your technical expertise and commitment to growth. We look for deep technical knowledge in your domain, active learning and staying current with industry trends, and sharing knowledge through documentation and mentoring. We value those who take pride in code quality and craftsmanship, and who seek opportunities to mentor and teach others.\n\nThink of it like this: Are you the person others come to for technical guidance? Do you actively seek ways to improve your craft?\n\n### Meaning: Your impact\n\nMeaning reflects your connection to the bigger picture. It's about understanding how your work contributes to larger goals and finding purpose in both open-source and enterprise projects. We value those who contribute to the broader tech community, align their personal values with professional work, and make a positive impact through technology.\n\nAsk yourself: Does your work matter to you beyond the paycheck? Are you building something that makes a difference?\n\n### Autonomy: Your initiative\n\nAutonomy measures your ability to work independently and take ownership. We value those who proactively identify and solve problems, take initiative without waiting for instructions, and manage their time and priorities effectively. Clear and transparent communication, along with consistent, high-quality delivery, are key indicators of autonomy.\n\nConsider: Are you someone who sees what needs to be done and does it? Do you take ownership of your work?\n\n![MMA](assets/mma.svg)\n\n## How MMA works in practice\n\nWe use MMA to guide growth and recognize achievement. Here's how it works:\n\nFirst, we use MMA to guide career development, helping identify growth areas and create personalized development paths. Second, we assess performance across technical skills, purpose alignment, and self-direction. Third, we acknowledge excellence through specific roles and rewards. Finally, we create opportunities to develop in all three dimensions.\n\n## Recognition through roles\n\nWe've created specific roles to recognize different aspects of MMA. The @labs role recognizes those whose technical expertise stands out. The @sers role celebrates those whose contributions to work and community make a difference. The @chad role acknowledges those who consistently deliver quality results with minimal supervision.\n\nThese roles aren't just titlesthey're recognition of your growth and impact.\n\n## The evaluation process\n\nWe take a balanced approach to evaluation. Our ops head looks at operational effectiveness and team contribution, accounting for 20% of the assessment. Line managers assess day-to-day performance and project delivery, contributing 30% of the evaluation. Leadership reviews overall impact and strategic alignment, making up the remaining 50%.\n\nThis multi-perspective approach ensures a fair and thorough assessment of your growth.\n\n## Creating the right environment\n\nMMA helps us build a culture where everyone can find purpose in their work. We celebrate technical excellence and share it freely. People have the freedom to innovate and create, while growth remains continuous and self-directed. We measure impact in both technical and human terms.\n\nRemember: MMA isn't about checking boxesit's about creating an environment where you can thrive while contributing to something meaningful. It's about measuring what matters, not what's easy to count.\n\n---\n\n> Next: [MMA](mma.md)\n","title":"MMA","short_title":"","description":"We measure what matters at Dwarves through MMA (Mastery, Meaning, Autonomy).

We recognize this isn't a black-and-white topic. One-time gigs, personal pursuits, and opportunities that help you grow can make life more interesting and fulfilling. We want to support these endeavors.\n\nAt the same time, we need to ensure outside work doesn't create conflicts of interest or affect your focus, dedication, or performance at Dwarves Foundation. Finding this balance requires thoughtful consideration.\n\n## Activities we support\n\nHere are some examples of outside work we consider acceptable:\n\n1. **Occasional side gigs** for people you know, whether free or paid. If you want to help a friend with their website or contribute to a design or writing project you're involved with, that's fine.\n2. **Speaking engagements**, free or paid. If someone wants to pay you to give a talk, that's acceptable as long as it doesn't require multiple days off for travel (unless you use vacation time for this purpose).\n3. **Side businesses** that differ from your day job, provided the commitment only amounts to a few hours per week. If you're exhausted at work because you're trying to launch a full-time business on the side, that impacts your performance here.\n4. **Advisory roles** for other companies, as long as there's no conflict of interest and the time commitment remains under a few hours per month. When scheduling conflicts arise, Dwarves Foundation takes priority.\n5. **Volunteer or pro-bono work** for causes you care about. Occasional contributions are fine, but becoming an organization's full-time web designer with responsibilities during your standard workday wouldn't be appropriate.\n\n## Activities that create conflicts\n\nHere are situations we consider problematic:\n\n1. **Working for another company in our industry**, either full-time or part-time. If you're unsure about what constitutes our industry and have a specific situation to discuss, please talk with Han.\n2. **Regular speaking tours** requiring multiple days of travel several times per year. This level of absence disrupts our work schedule and affects your teammates.\n3. **Consulting for potential competitors** or companies with products related to Dwarves Foundation where conflicts of interest might arise.\n4. **Aggressively marketing yourself** for side work. If opportunities come through friends or connections, that's acceptable, but actively promoting your availability for side work will eventually create conflicts with your work here.\n5. **Outside commitments that divert attention from your work**. For example, launching an app that requires timely customer support would pull focus from your responsibilities at Dwarves Foundation.\n\n## Guiding principles\n\nWhen considering outside work, ask yourself these questions:\n\n* Is it competitive with what we do?\n* Will it take up too much of your time?\n* Does it require you to be absent during times when your team needs you?\n* Is it another paid opportunity using the same skills Dwarves Foundation is paying you for?\n\nWe aim to be reasonable about outside work, but we need to be firm when it affects your time, attention, or performance here.\n\nSince every situation is unique, reach out to Han or An if you're uncertain about a specific opportunity. We're happy to discuss it before you make any commitments.\n","title":"Moonlighting","short_title":"","description":"We support your growth through side projects while ensuring they don't conflict with your work at Dwarves Foundation.

You've likely noticed this cycle. AI is the current big shift, but before that, we adapted to DevOps, mobile, and the cloud. Each wave brings new tools and changes what clients need from us.\n\nAs a consulting company, we offer tech know how to help others succeed. Just mastering today's tools isn't enough. A core challenge is understanding and adapting to these ongoing tech changes. Clients trust our knowledge. They expect us to be skilled with current tech and aware of what might come next. Technology doesn't stand still. If we fall behind, we become less useful and competitive.\n\nTo stay relevant, we need a way to look ahead and adapt. This means asking ourselves key questions:\n\n- Which technologies might form the next wave?\n- How can we best position our team's knowledge and skills?\n- What lessons did we learn from past tech cycles?\n\n![The chasm](assets/the-chasm.png)\n\n### How we adapt\n\nBig platform changes or tech breakthroughs can trigger our process. We've developed a data-driven way at Dwarves to handle these shifts, which involves several stages.\n\nFirst, we **gather information**. We collect data from public sources like industry news and market trends, and from our internal discussions, like those on Discord. Insights also come up from our own project experiences.\n\nNext, we **understand the data**. We analyze this information, looking for new keywords or trends, to spot promising new tech. Once we identify a potential technology, we dig deeper by asking important questions: What are experts and the community saying about it? Can this tech help us or our clients build something valuable?\n\nFinally, we **make decisions**. Based on the answers, we decide how to proceed. If a technology looks promising, we might develop needed skills within the team, create demos or content to explore what it can do, or join early events like hackathons to get more involved. We also make sure to document what we learn from each cycle.\n\nThis structured, data-driven approach helps us evaluate new tech methodically and stay prepared.\n\n### Tools we use\n\nTo support this process, we build internal tools like the [knowledge base](knowledge-base.md) and the [Tech Radar](community/radar.md). These tools help us:\n\n- Collect and organize information consistently.\n- Make sense of new trends.\n- Decide which tech to adopt or explore further.\n\nThe aim is to manage tech changes predictably, support our growth, and keep our ability to react well when things shift unexpectedly.\n\n### Your role in this\n\nThis process works best when everyone adds to it. Understanding how we adapt to tech changes is the first step. You can get involved by sharing relevant articles, news, or insights you find, sharing your observations from projects or client talks, and helping organize information in our knowledge base or suggesting ways to improve our tools and process.\n\nYour input strengthens our ability to handle the future. It shows you're thinking not just about your daily tasks, but about how we collectively stay ahead.

We're building not just software, but a legacy of innovation that extends beyond our immediate horizon.\n\nWhen you join Dwarves Foundation, you become part of this larger purpose, creating an environment where innovation thrives and meaningful change becomes possible.\n\n![Dwarves Foundation team](assets/team-photo.webp)\n\n---\n\n> Next: [Navigate changes](navigate-changes.md)\n","title":"Our purpose","short_title":"Purpose","description":"We serve a single purpose, to empower innovations and co-create the next big things.","tags":["handbook","purpose"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao"],"date":"Wed Jul 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"handbook/purpose.md","slugArray":["handbook","purpose"]},{"content":"\nAs mentioned in [how we work](how-we-work.md), we keep our teams small and embrace agile principles at scale. This approach helps us stay nimble while delivering consistent quality.\n\n## The 8-week cycle\n\nWe organize our work in 8-week cycles, typically running six cycles per year. This fixed timeframe creates a healthy sense of urgency, prevents scope creep in our projects, and provides regular intervals to reassess our priorities.\n\nAt the end of each cycle, we take time for reflection and celebration. We acknowledge achievements and contributions, hunt for new opportunities, publish our tech radar findings, and take a brief cooling period before planning the next cycle.\n\n## A day in the life\n\nOur workdays follow a consistent rhythm that balances focused work with necessary collaboration:\n\n- **9 AM Monday**: Operations meeting brings together team leads to check status and plan the week's priorities, while Basecamp sends out the activity digest and prompts team members with \"What will you be working on this week?\"\n- **10 AM Monday**: Sprint planning meetings kick off the week for teams starting a new sprint. After planning, everyone shifts to focused work.\n- **12-1 PM**: Lunch break gives everyone time to recharge.\n- **3 PM Friday**: Teams closing a sprint hold retrospective meetings to reflect on what worked and what could improve.\n- **4 PM Friday**: Engineering and Design teams hold monthly meetings on the last Friday of each month.\n- **5 PM**: Basecamp prompts everyone with \"What did you work on today?\" to capture progress.\n- **6 PM**: We wrap up the workday.\n\n## The rhythm of the week\n\nWhile Monday marks the official start of our workweek, many of us begin forming our to-do lists by Sunday evening. Sound familiar?\n\n### Monday: Planning day\n\nMonday revolves around business planning and project meetings. These typically run from our 9 AM start until lunchtime. Your afternoon is for catching up on work and perhaps completing a few small tasks. Don't expect to tackle major items on Mondays, they're for getting oriented.\n\n### Tuesday: Discussion day\n\nTuesday is prime time for team discussions and client stand-ups. If you need to discuss something with colleagues or hand off tasks, don't wait, Tuesday is your window. We've learned from experience that tasks assigned later in the week (Wednesday or Thursday) often slide to the following week.\n\n### Wednesday & Thursday: Deep work days\n\nThese are your most productive days, protect them. With meetings behind you, use this uninterrupted time to focus on substantial work and clear your plate of important tasks.\n\n### Friday: Wrap-up day\n\nFriday arrives faster than you'd expect. We use it to close loops, summarize weekly progress, and prepare for what's next. Our Project Status meeting at 1 PM gives PMs the chance to update everyone on team progress and client feedback.\n\n### Saturday: Your choice\n\nHow you spend Saturday is up to you. Most of us consider our week complete by Friday afternoon and dedicate weekend time to personal life and family. It's perfectly fine, encouraged, even, to disconnect completely.\n\nSome Dwarves occasionally use Saturdays for hotfixes or side projects that genuinely interest them. You'll also receive our team newsletter in your inbox, summarizing the week's highlights so you don't miss anything important.\n\n## Beyond client work\n\nWhile client projects are our bread and butter, we invest time in other activities that help us grow together.\n\n### Open source and internal products\n\nWe create tools and products that solve our own problems first. We use them internally, refining them through real-world testing before considering wider release. Our [Open Source]() projects reflect this philosophy.\n\n### Ventures products\n\nThrough [Dwarves Ventures](https://dwarves.ventures), our investment arm, we exchange technical expertise for equity in promising startups. We help shape their products and elevate their technical capabilities, creating mutual value. Learn more about our [venture deals and internal product incubation](ventures.md).\n\n### Tech radar\n\nStaying current in software development requires continuous learning. Every two months, we conduct Tech Radar sessions where team members research technologies they find interesting or potentially valuable to our work. Outstanding research is recognized internally and published for our wider community. Read more about our [tech radar process]().\n\n---\n\n> Next: [Who does what](who-does-what.md)\n","title":"Work routine","short_title":"","description":"How we structure our time to maximize creativity, productivity, and balance","tags":["handbook","workflow"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao"],"date":"Wed Aug 12 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"handbook/routine.md","slugArray":["handbook","routine"]},{"content":"\n## Basic Security\n\nKeeping laptops and phones secure is vitally important.

If you joined after 2018, this section will help you understand an important part of how we operate beyond client services.\n\n## Our venture investment model\n\nBeyond our core tech R&D and offshore services for companies, we actively invest in early-stage startups with promising potential. These companies aren't selected at random, they're carefully evaluated by our [Dwarves Ventures](https://dwarves.ventures) investment team.\n\nWhat makes our approach unique is how we engage: we don't just provide funding, we become the technical backbone of these startups. We step into CTO roles and provide engineering teams, bringing hands-on experience to help these companies navigate their bootstrap phase and secure later rounds of funding.\n\nWhile the success rate of this model is still emerging, the potential is significant. For Dwarves who become key maintainers of these products, there's an opportunity to receive a small ownership stake in the future or access to discounted ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan) options.\n\n## Building for makers and developers\n\nWe're working on several initiatives to build an ecosystem supporting makers and programmers. We're deeply involved with different developer and creator communities, and we've noticed the significant annual growth in development teams and indie studios, creating new opportunities for us to contribute.\n\nOur Superbits team is developing tools and products targeting this market, with plans to commercialize them. When you contribute to these products in your free time, you gain the chance to work on projects you're passionate about while earning ownership stakes in these products.\n\n## Your own side projects\n\nWe encourage you to build your own side projects during investment time. If your project shows potential, the team may provide funding for further development. Other team members might join you to help bring the product to market.\n\nFeel free to register your interest in any of these categories, ventures, maker tools, or your own projects.\n\n## A note on product ownership\n\nBuilding your own products comes with unique challenges. Unlike client work, there's often no pre-defined roadmap or someone to break down tasks for you. You won't have someone coaching you through every step or providing ready solutions when you get stuck.\n\nThis is the essence of being a \"manager of one\", you'll need to define your direction, solve your own problems, and push through obstacles independently. It's challenging work, but the rewards, both in growth and potential ownership, can be substantial.\n","title":"Ventures arm","short_title":"","description":"How we invest in and build the future through our ventures initiatives","tags":["handbook","ventures"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao"],"date":"Thu Jul 02 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"handbook/ventures.md","slugArray":["handbook","ventures"]},{"content":"\n## Empower Innovation with Software Craftsmanship\n\nInnovation happens constantly. Every day, startups form and secure funding to pursue their visions, striving to create positive change, impact millions of lives, achieve breakthroughs, and build foundations for economic growth.\n\nBut building an innovative startup is incredibly challenging. Founders juggle business development, legal considerations, fundraising, team building, and product development simultaneously. They need to move quickly and often \"break things\" along the way.\n\nAs these startups grow, they eventually need a strong, experienced team behind them. This is where we come in, providing the software expertise that helps design robust systems, create effective databases, produce well-crafted code, maintain stability, avoid technical debt, and deliver real value. We're a critical piece of the innovation puzzle.\n\n## Why we created Dwarves Foundation\n\nWe started Dwarves Foundation partly in response to the lack of respect that service firms often receive. Many software companies focus solely on digital transformation and consultancy, operating under tight deadlines and budgets that force them to cut corners. They \"hit and run,\" leaving behind codebases full of problems, an approach that damages our professional pride.\n\nDespite the limitations of service firms, linear scaling, smaller ultimate size, and fewer opportunities for life-changing exits, we built Dwarves Foundation because we believe in building things right. Companies like ours are more vital to the economy than they're often given credit for.\n\n## An innovation service firm\n\nSince 2013, we've been building an organization with high software development standards and strong business growth capabilities. We help tech startups, entrepreneurs, and makers deliver innovative software products that make a difference.\n\n## Champions of software craftsmanship\n\nRather than simply telling people how to build software, we take responsibility for collaboratively creating innovative products with our clients. We value long-term partnerships that generate economic impact through quality software that reaches the market through our clients.\n\nThis commitment to craftsmanship takes many forms, and we're constantly working to improve our approach.\n\n## Our name: The Dwarves\n\n![Norse mythology's Yggdrasill tree](assets/yggdrasill.webp)\n\nOur name has roots in Norse mythology. After Odin executed Ymir, the first giant of the universe, he created a new cosmos centered around Yggdrasill, a massive ash tree that cradles the nine realms.\n\nDwarves began as small creatures originating from Ymir's corpse. They made their home in the mountains deep underground in Svartalfheim. These beings possessed natural wisdom and exceptional skills in smithing, mining, and crafting. They became renowned as the finest blacksmiths across the nine worlds, excelling not just in creating weapons and jewelry, but also as engineers and architects.\n\nThe magic of the Dwarves wasn't flashy or showy, it was their extraordinary technical knowledge and craftsmanship. There was no shimmering light surrounding them, just exceptional workmanship. They took immense pride in their craft, whether smithing or any other pursuit.\n\nDwarves represent beings whose abilities transcend the known world, pointing toward possibilities beyond the physical realm. Their existence expands our imagination of what's possible.\n\n## Living our values\n\nWe chose the name \"Dwarves Foundation\" as a commitment to our vision of creating positive breakthroughs that can reshape the world. In our woodland, we encourage thorough assessment and evaluation of product quality before delivery to customers.\n\nBy participating in every detail of our work, we make craftsmanship a fundamental element in the professional development of our engineers. Creating world-class products requires world-class engineers, and craftsmanship is what makes this possible. Craftsmanship flows through our team spirit, or doesn't exist at all.\n\nWe've chosen innovation as a core value because we believe in forming ideas that positively impact society. Innovation isn't the work of isolated geniuses, it's an activity requiring team effort. Being innovative helps us approach the new era we're building together. The rewards of this approach can genuinely help remodel our world.\n\n![Dwarves Foundation team](assets/dwarves-team.webp)\n\n---\n\n> Next: [The Purpose](purpose.md)\n","title":"What we stand for","short_title":"","description":"How we empower innovation through software craftsmanship and build products that matter","tags":["handbook","purpose"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao","duy"],"date":"Thu Feb 21 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"handbook/what-we-stand-for.md","slugArray":["handbook","what-we-stand-for"]},{"content":"\nValues come first. They guide our decisions, shape our culture, and define who we are as a company. They're what we're proud of and what helps us navigate difficult choices. They'll likely be what you appreciate most about working with us at Dwarves Foundation.\n\nOur core values guide both our strategic direction and our day-to-day actions, creating a company whose character is as distinctive as our work:\n\n- **Craftsmanship**: We pursue excellence in everything we create. We take pride in developing well-crafted software together.\n- **Teamwork**: We build on trust and collaboration. Being part of our team means we can rely on you, and you can rely on us.\n- **Sustainability**: We think long-term. We don't believe in rushing projects or working excessive hours. We value balanced, sustainable work that keeps us healthy, happy, and producing our best.\n\n## Our culture code\n\nThere's no rigid formula for culture. Too many company handbooks present idealized versions of how people should act rather than honest descriptions of how they actually do. We're committed to keeping it real.\n\nWe believe culture emerges from who we hire, what we celebrate, and what we encourage. It's dynamic and evolves with our organization. We welcome change as long as we remain grounded in our core values. Just as we want people to contribute new skills and ideas, we welcome their contributions to our evolving culture.\n\n![Company culture](assets/value-culture.webp)\n\nOver the years, we've developed a few additional principles:\n\n- [**No asshole rule**](https://www.amazon.com/Asshole-Rule-Civilized-Workplace-Surviving/dp/0446698202): No matter how talented a candidate may be, being difficult or toxic is an automatic disqualifier.\n- **False positives are acceptable, false negatives are not**: We'd rather pass on a potentially good hire than bring in someone who might harm our team dynamics.\n\n## People\n\n### It starts with people\n\nEverything begins with us, humans. All we want to accomplish starts with our will and vision. Our ideas for creating a better future begin with people. While we focus on innovation, those results only matter if they benefit people. We are the center and beginning of everything we do.\n\nAt Dwarves, you manage yourself. What you create adds to our collective value. How you act represents our image. Your beliefs influence our culture. When things go wrong, we look inward rather than casting blame. Ultimately, we humans create our own consequences.\n\nSo, bring your values and contribute your knowledge to our team. We're better because of what each person brings.\n\n![Decision making](assets/value-decisions.webp)\n\n### The team comes first\n\nWorking with us is like rowing a boat together, requiring perfect coordination. While we need individuals with excellent skills, the team's success depends on synchronization more than individual heroics. The skillset matters, but vision and coordination matter more. Every individual must think of the team first.\n\nAs a team member, remember that everyone has room to grow, including yourself. Be supportive. Offer constructive feedback. And most importantly, listen. Those who only talk without listening limit their own growth.\n\n> \"Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.\" — Bill Nye\n\nWe've created an environment where healthy competition and collaboration coexist and strengthen each other. Whether competing or collaborating, making the boat move faster is always the goal. Remember, even if you work harder than anyone else, if you're not in sync with the team, you'll slow everyone down.\n\n![The I in team](assets/value-teamwork.webp)\n\n### Beyond the individual\n\nWhat happens at Dwarves isn't about any single person, not the CEO, not the core team, not anyone. We're all here because we want to unite our efforts to achieve excellence in software engineering and empower innovation.\n\nThe Dwarves is more like an ideology than a conventional company. When we started, we were excited about making this ideology real, creating positive impact, and building meaningful livelihoods.\n\nOur resources are allocated accordingly. We establish guidelines for everyone pursuing this shared path, everyone who wants to contribute and make innovative products possible. We work together toward a greater good because when it becomes about individuals alone, things fall apart.\n\n![Team effort](assets/value-collaboration.webp)\n\n### Finding like-minded people\n\nWe founded this team with purpose: to power innovation. Our long-term goal is to create an environment where new ideas flourish, where we develop meaningful technologies and create positive impact. We aim to build a place where engineers can work with groundbreaking startups while enjoying what they do.\n\nAchieving this vision requires significant dedication and commitment. That's why we seek like-minded people who share our vision, DNA, and energy. We value those who think differently, see things clearly, and remain optimistic about the future.\n\n![Like-minded people](assets/value-like-minded.webp)\n\n### Valuing uniqueness\n\nWhen hiring, we look for what makes each person special. We hire for unique value, for what you bring to the table that differentiates you from others.\n\nBeing different is always valuable. These differences can take many forms: thinking style, technology vision, operational approach, presentation skills, communication ability, leadership capability, prototyping speed, emotional intelligence, or countless other qualities.\n\nWe strive to be an organization that respects and leverages these unique qualities rather than reducing people to standardized technical evaluations like school exams.\n\n![Unique values](assets/value-uniqueness.webp)\n\n### The importance of emotional intelligence\n\nWe've seen many brilliant engineers with high IQs struggle while others with strong emotional intelligence succeed. Often, the difference comes down to communication.\n\nClients frequently tell us what feature they want rather than what problem they need to solve. Failing to see beyond their request can lead to situations where implementing the requested feature becomes technically impossible, while alternative approaches to the underlying problem remain unexplored. This dynamic explains why clients prefer working with some teams over others.\n\nAs a software firm, our job is to recommend solutions, not just implement features. Technical tasks, bugs, and features are just one side of the coin; understanding the real problem is the other. Train yourself to see the bigger picture.\n\n![Communication skills](assets/value-communication.webp)\n\n### Actions over words\n\nPeople judge you by what you do, not what you say. Be a doer. We craft software to create positive impact.\n\nAt Dwarves, we value building over talking. We prefer to work with those who contribute tangible value and make things happen.\n\nWe pursue a culture that balances unconventional thinking with doing the right thing in every decision, not simply following established patterns.\n\n![Efficiency and action](assets/value-efficiency.webp)\n\n## How we work\n\n### Remote by default\n\nWe don't micromanage your physical presence. We have more important priorities than tracking your location minute by minute. We reserve meetings for decision-making, while ideas and planning can happen asynchronously.\n\nHowever, flexibility requires responsibility. Flexible work arrangements are powerful but require self-management. You need to know what must be done each day, what's a priority, and what can wait.\n\nWork can happen anywhere, whether in your kitchen or at the beach. We want you to manage your work on your terms. Just make sure you know what needs to happen and how you'll accomplish it.\n\n![Time management](assets/value-time-mgmt.webp)\n\n### Quality over hours\n\nWe work for our collective future. We care about the quality of what we produce rather than the number of hours worked. We don't enforce specific start or end times.\n\nOur team operates across different time zones, staying connected around the clock. Dwarves are available when needed, but we respect each other's work-life balance. Don't take advantage of someone's availability.\n\n### Automation mindset\n\nTime is our most precious resource. The techniques and technologies we embrace at Dwarves Foundation help us save time through automation. If something happens more than three times and will likely recur, we find a way to automate it.\n\nAs software transforms the world, tasks we perform today can be automated tomorrow. With our engineering capabilities, we can eliminate repetitive work and focus on what truly matters. Don't repeat yourself.\n\n![Automation value](assets/value-time-investment.webp)\n\n### Going beyond expectations\n\nThe Dwarves often spend their free time exploring new technologies and working on side projects. This extra effort extends our capabilities and increases our chances of reaching new heights.\n\nPutting in that additional 20% effort represents our commitment to excellence. While not required, it's encouraged and rewarded when the things we build bring value to customers or reach the market successfully.\n\n![Opportunity and growth](assets/value-opportunity.webp)\n\n### Purpose-driven work\n\nWe focus on results, ensuring every action brings us closer to our goals. When consulting with clients, we must understand what makes a collaboration successful.\n\nRemote clients often worry about delivery. Without updates, they assume no progress. While we don't monitor where you work, transparency is crucial. Detailed planning and regular reports build trust. Insisting on daily status meetings often indicates trust issues rather than effective agile practices.\n\nTo succeed with clients:\n\n- Make development progress as transparent as possible\n- Be a team player, not just a \"task worker\"\n- Favor open discussion and alternative recommendations over simply rejecting client requests\n\n![Progress measurement](assets/value-progress.webp)\n\n### Building partnerships, not transactions\n\nIn our work with others, we pursue partnerships, not just business. We value lifetime relationships. While deals and markets come and go, trusted clients remain. Once people experience our well-crafted work, they rarely want to risk working with alternatives. The quality speaks for itself.\n\nSimilar to networking, business is about giving before taking. We often contribute value upfront before asking for anything in return.\n\nUnfortunately, many approach business asking \"what can you do for me?\" rather than \"how can we grow together?\" Whether due to skepticism or past disappointments, many business owners focus on immediate gains rather than investing in sustainable, long-term relationships.\n\n![Business partnership](assets/value-partnership.webp)\n\n### Everyone contributes directly\n\nEverybody works. In a small team, we need people who do the work, not just assign it. Everyone must contribute directly. No one stands above the actual work.\n\nThis means avoiding \"delegators,\" people who primarily tell others what to do. They create bottlenecks by generating busywork and making up new tasks when they run out of things to assign, regardless of actual needs.\n\nDelegators gravitate toward meetings, where they appear important while pulling others away from productive work.\n\n![Effective meetings](assets/value-meetings.webp)\n\n### Effectiveness over busyness\n\nBeing productive means filling your schedule and completing many tasks. Being effective means having more unoccupied time for things beyond work. We value effectiveness, not busyness.\n\nWe focus on creating the most value possible in the time available. Between signal and noise, we choose signal and filter out distractions.\n\nKnow your priorities and focus on what truly matters.\n\n![Focus on effectiveness](assets/value-effectiveness.webp)\n\n## Engineering culture\n\nWe're building a company where software engineering excellence shines, where innovative products ship and change the world for the better.\n\n### Engineering discipline\n\nSoftware engineering applies systematic approaches to software development. Without proper methods, software becomes more expensive and less reliable over time. As changes accumulate, costs increase dramatically.\n\n![Engineering discipline](assets/value-engineering.webp)\n\n### Valuing craftspeople\n\nIn every software project, the engineering team is critical to success. Software development is more craft than assembly line, and engineers aren't interchangeable parts.\n\nThe assembly line mindset is an industrial age relic. We reject standardized interview processes with arbitrary whiteboard problems that diminish individuality and treat engineers as replaceable components.\n\n### Meritocracy of ideas\n\nIf you have a great idea and the determination to implement it, you can create significant change. Nothing is off-limits. We constantly seek improvements in our people, processes, and products. Every voice matters, regardless of role or seniority.\n\nIf your idea makes the most sense, that's what we'll pursue.\n\n![Quality code](assets/value-quality.webp)\n\n### Lean thinking\n\nThe lean philosophy considers anything that doesn't add customer value as waste. To eliminate waste, we must recognize it. Partially completed work, unnecessary processes, unused features, rework, overly complex solutions, waiting time, and management overhead not producing real value all qualify as waste.\n\nResults matter more than approach or process. Fancy tools and complicated procedures often create more problems than they solve.\n\nAlways remember you're the manager of one. Know what success looks like and what your priorities are. There will always be distractions and misleading directions. Focus on the signal and filter out the noise.\n\nFavor proven, straightforward solutions over shiny new technologies chasing popularity. Be practical and don't waste effort on uncertainties.\n\n![Simple solutions](assets/value-simplicity.webp)\n\n![Automation focus](assets/value-automation.webp)\n\n### Long-term thinking\n\nHow do we know if we're making the right decisions?\n\nEvery action creates chains of cause and effect. When making decisions, we follow a shared framework based on collective benefit rather than individual gain.\n\nToday's decisions impact our future. The technologies we adopt, the solutions we implement, the founders we support, the startups we invest in, the people we hire, and how we treat clients all create lasting impacts. Even how we talk about ourselves and our attitude toward peers matters.\n\nEveryone at Dwarves has the authority to make decisions as long as they benefit the whole organization in the long run rather than serving short-term individual interests. It's like walking a tightrope, requiring careful balance.\n\n![Long-term thinking](assets/value-long-term.webp)\n\n## Building the future\n\n![Looking to the future](assets/value-future.webp)\n\n### Software's expanding role\n\nSoftware runs our world. It surrounds us, though few people consider how deeply it impacts daily life. Businesses use software to communicate globally. It operates complex medical equipment. It makes our lives more convenient in countless ways.\n\nSoftware is transforming every industry. Whatever the future holds, software will remain essential. As it becomes more sophisticated, it will help us tackle increasingly complex challenges.\n\nIn the future, software may even help regulate and improve our bodies. Today's wearable devices and medical implants are just the beginning of what next-generation software will enable.\n\nThe tech industry sits at the intersection of all sectors. It's our fastest-evolving environment and the frontier where humanity pushes boundaries. It's our pathway to the future. Organizations increasingly depend on integrating digital technology into their core strategies. Our world can no longer function without software.\n\n![Software impact](assets/value-software-impact.webp)\n\n### Creating a resilient future\n\nHumanity faces tremendous opportunities to expand possibilities across sectors. The future ahead is dynamic and exciting. Without carefully considering the impact of our actions on future generations, we risk unintentionally causing harm.\n\nAs an ambitious team co-creating the future with startups and makers, we must remain mindful of our actions and maintain a long-term perspective. This awareness helps us avoid short-sighted decisions and build a sustainable future.\n\n![Resilient future](assets/value-resilience.webp)\n\n![Documentation importance](assets/value-documentation.webp)\n","title":"What we value","short_title":"","description":"Our core values guide our strategies and individual actions so that we create a company whose character is as radical as our work.","tags":["handbook","culture"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao","duy"],"date":"Thu Feb 21 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"handbook/what-we-value.md","slugArray":["handbook","what-we-value"]},{"content":"\n### Office\n\nThe Dwarves HQ is in Saigon, Vietnam. Fifty-ish people and two cats have desk space in the Saigon office, but those people also work from home regularly. We expand the office space when the old one is full and people want the new office. Anyone is welcome to visit Saigon and work from the office at any time.\n\n### From home\n\nA few people at Dwarves Foundation are based in other countries and they work from home most of the time. Getting the basics right will make a big difference: [a good chair and a good desk](https://medium.com/dwarves-foundation/dfstaythefhome-5e416a4c457c).\n\n### From coffee shops\n\nWorking from home all the time isn’t everyone’s cup of coffee. Thus, lots of us choose to work from coffee shops or other third spaces either some of the time or a lot of the time. Great for a buzz of other people and much-needed [caffeine](https://giphy.com/gifs/bobs-burgers-fox-bobs-burgers-tv-3o72F3CQSLwU7XTlDy) of course, but please do mind our [basic security rules](security-rules.md) and procedures to ensure that nothing leaks on to the cafe wifi.\n\n### From a coworking space\n\nIf working from home or from a coffee shop doesn’t suit you, then trying a coworking space might just do the trick. We support a $50/month stipend towards a desk in such a place.\n\nThere are a few [places](places-to-work.md) that we usually visit.\n","title":"Where we work","short_title":"","description":"The Dwarves HQ is in Saigon, Vietnam.

Most things fall within the focus of a specific group or \"chair\" at Dwarves Foundation. While the people mentioned here are good starting points, remember everyone at Dwarves is approachable and happy to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, ask it – chances are you're not the first.\n\n## Our expectations\n\nWe define clear expectations for each role. If you're qualified for the job, we trust you know what needs doing. We expect everyone to take ownership of their responsibilities and actively work towards our shared goals.\n\n## Going beyond your role\n\nMeeting expectations is the baseline, but we encourage everyone to go further. We love seeing Dwarves push the boundaries of their roles and even take on responsibilities that might traditionally fall elsewhere. When we notice people stepping up, we actively look for ways to support their growth, whether through new activities or adjusted roles.\n\nWe foster a culture where you feel empowered in your role and comfortable exploring new directions as you grow.\n\n## Our structure: the leading chairs\n\nInstead of rigid departments, we organize ourselves around key delivery areas or \"chairs.\" This helps us focus on impact and adapt as needed. Here are our main chairs:\n\n### Partnership\n\nThis chair focuses on building and maintaining strong relationships with our clients and partners. It covers aspects like understanding client needs, ensuring project alignment, and exploring new growth opportunities. **Han** and **Minh** are key contacts here.\n\n### Delivery\n\nThe delivery chair is all about crafting and shipping high-quality products and technical solutions. **Huy N** helps manage our delivery efforts. This includes:\n\n* **Product strategy & design:** Defining product direction and ensuring intuitive, well-designed user experiences. **Anna** contributes significantly to our design efforts.\n* **Engineering:** Building robust backend systems, APIs, web frontends, and mobile/desktop applications. **Thanh P** helps guide our web engineering efforts.\n* **Infrastructure:** Ensuring our systems and our clients' infrastructure are reliable, scalable, and secure. **Quang** helps lead our infrastructure operations (SRE).\n* **Quality assurance:** Rigorously testing our work to catch issues before they reach users.\n\n### Learning\n\nContinuous learning is core to our craft. This chair ensures we keep growing our skills and sharing knowledge effectively, whether through internal initiatives, documentation, or exploring new technologies. **Tom** heads up our research efforts within this area.\n\n### Communication\n\nThis chair focuses on how we tell our story, both internally and externally. It involves sharing updates, maintaining our public presence (like our website and publications), and ensuring clear, transparent communication across the board.\n\n### Engagement\n\nThe Engagement chair works to make Dwarves Foundation an excellent place to work. This includes supporting our team's well-being, fostering a positive culture, managing people operations, and helping individuals navigate their career paths and growth within the company. **Huy N** plays a key role here, bridging operations and engineering perspectives, and is often a great first point of contact if you're unsure who to talk to about workplace or career questions.\n\n## Executive leadership\n\n### CEO\n\n**Han** is our CEO and founder. He sets the overall direction for Dwarves Foundation, guides our strategy, and helps ensure we have the right people to achieve our vision.\n\n---\n\n> Next: [How we work](how-we-work.md)\n","title":"Who does what","short_title":"","description":"Figuring out who to ask about a specific issue or question shouldn't be a guessing game.
