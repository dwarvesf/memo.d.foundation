market. They envisioned a set of digital tools specifically designed for 2-3 star hotels in Vietnam, but needed technical expertise to turn this vision into reality.\n\nWhen we joined the project, Aharooms had already spent nearly two years developing their system but was struggling with slow progress. They faced the common challenge of balancing new feature development with fixing existing issues in their codebase.\n\nWe stepped in as their dedicated product team, dramatically accelerating development and helping them finally deliver their solution to hotel owners who needed it. Our work enabled Aharooms to focus on expanding their market reach while we handled the technical heavy lifting.\n\n![Aharooms platform showing hotel property and mobile app interface](assets/aharooms-main.webp)\n\n## The challenge Aharooms faced\n\nSmall hotels in Vietnam (typically 2-3 stars) represent a significant market opportunity but face substantial challenges. Most of these hotels operate with inconsistent service quality and outdated business practices that limit their growth potential. They often lack the resources and know-how to implement modern hotel management systems.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit, these challenges intensified. Small hotels were particularly vulnerable to the sudden drop in tourism, and many realized they needed to quickly adapt their business models and offer new services to survive.\n\nAharooms identified this need and wanted to create a comprehensive solution specifically tailored to the Vietnamese market. They aimed to provide everything these small hotels needed: growth tools, management systems, booking channels, customer service features, and revenue optimization capabilities.\n\nThe technical challenge was significant: build a system that was powerful enough to handle all these functions but simple enough for small hotel owners to use without extensive training.\n\n![Aharooms website displayed on different devices](assets/aharooms-website.webp)\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe took a practical approach to creating Aharooms' system, focusing on reliability, ease of maintenance, and meeting the specific needs of Vietnamese hotel owners.\n\n### Technical approach\n\nWe made several key technical decisions to ensure the system would be stable and scalable:\n\n**Simplified architecture**: We deliberately chose a monolithic architecture instead of microservices to make the codebase easier to manage and iterate on. This was important given Aharooms' need to move quickly and their previous development challenges.\n\n**Cloud-based infrastructure**: We set up the system using Docker containers and Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform, with servers based in Singapore for optimal performance in Vietnam. This approach kept each client's data separate and secure.\n\n**Performance optimization**: We used Netlify to host the React.js frontend sites, which helped avoid traffic bottlenecks and made updates smoother. This setup ensured that users would have a fast, responsive experience even during traffic spikes.\n\n**Quality assurance**: We implemented a rigorous testing process with automated tests and careful code reviews to catch issues early. With four separate environments (Local, CI, Staging, and Production), we could thoroughly test features before releasing them.\n\n**Data insights**: We set up PostgreSQL databases with Metabase dashboards to help Aharooms understand business performance. This enabled them to make data-driven decisions about their product and market strategy.\n\n**Developer ecosystem**: We created a developer portal with open APIs to encourage third-party integration, allowing other developers to build tools within the Aharooms ecosystem.\n\n![Aharooms cloud infrastructure diagram showing system components](assets/aharooms-infrastructure.webp)\n\n### Product features\n\nWe helped Aharooms build a complete package of services for hotels, focusing on three main areas:\n\n**Hotel management tools**:\n\n- A direct booking platform that functioned like \"Shopify for hotels,\" making it easy to set up different room types and rates\n- A property management system (PMS) that served as a central hub for managing bookings from various channels\n- Simple tools for handling daily operations, budgets, and promotional campaigns\n\n![Aharooms property management system dashboard](assets/aharooms-pms.webp)\n\n**Customer retention features**:\n\n- A loyalty system using \"Ahacoin\" to provide cashback incentives for repeat customers\n- Visual performance reports to help hotel owners understand their business metrics\n- Analysis of booking cancellations to help hotels identify and address common issues\n\n**Revenue optimization**:\n\n- Revenue management system (RMS) with tools to help hotels maximize sales while controlling costs\n- Integration with other booking platforms to increase visibility\n- Support for flexible booking options like hourly rooms and corporate partnerships\n\n![Aharooms booking interface showing room selection](assets/aharooms-booking.webp)\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nWe worked closely with the Aharooms team, functioning as their in-house product development department. This tight collaboration allowed us to:\n\n- Understand the specific needs of Vietnamese hotel owners through regular workshop sessions\n- Quickly adjust features based on market feedback\n- Provide technical guidance on product decisions\n- Help them prioritize development efforts for maximum impact\n\nOur team handled everything from initial design through implementation and deployment, while maintaining open communication with Aharooms' business team.\n\n![Aharooms team workshop session discussing product features](assets/aharooms-workshop.webp)\n\n## What we achieved\n\nOur partnership with Aharooms produced significant results for both the company and its hotel clients:\n\n**For Aharooms**:\n\n- Successfully launched their product in the Vietnamese market\n- Gained recognition as an innovative solution for small hotels\n- Built a scalable platform that could grow with their business\n- Created multiple potential revenue streams from their hotel clients\n\n**For hotel owners**:\n\n- Provided an all-in-one system that simplified their operations\n- Enabled online bookings and digital management during COVID-19\n- Offered data-driven insights to improve business performance\n- Created new ways to retain customers and maximize revenue\n\nAs both a technical partner and venture builder, we helped Aharooms design their product to maximize revenue potential, especially during the critical COVID pandemic period when hotels needed to adapt quickly to survive.\n\nThe system we built together allowed Aharooms to establish itself in the market and positioned them for continued growth as the hospitality industry recovered.\n","title":"Building a complete tech system for small Vietnamese hotels","short_title":"Aharooms","description":"We helped Aharooms create a suite of digital tools that enables small hotels in Vietnam to improve operations, increase bookings, and boost revenue—especially during the challenging COVID-19 period when adaptation was crucial.","tags":["hospitality","case-study"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao","duy","nikki"],"date":"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"consulting/case-study/aharooms.md","slugArray":["consulting","case-study","aharooms"]},{"content":"\n**Industry**\\\nEnergy Management / Internet of Things (IoT)\n\n**Location**\\\nVietnam\n\n**Business context**\\\nBusinesses needed a way to monitor electrical equipment in real-time to save money and prevent problems\n\n**Solution**\\\nBuilt an AI-powered system that collects data from monitoring devices and provides actionable insights\n\n**Outcome**\\\nDelivered a complete platform with mobile apps, dashboard, and AI engine that helps businesses optimize energy usage\n\n**Our service**\\\nFull-stack Development / AI Integration / IoT System Design\n\n## Technical highlights\n\n- **Core system**: Go-powered microservices handling device lifecycle management\n- **AI engine**: Custom machine learning for device detection and usage prediction\n- **Mobile apps**: Native iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin) applications\n- **Database architecture**: MongoDB for real-time updates and DynamoDB for AI data\n- **Device connectivity**: WiFi connection using ESP2866 protocol \n- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP for reliable hosting\n\n![AirWatt electricity monitoring system](assets/airwatt-main.webp)\n\n## What we did with AirWatt\n\nAirWatt is a smart system that uses artificial intelligence to monitor and improve how businesses use electricity. It helps companies track their electrical equipment in real-time, so they can save money on power bills and prevent problems caused by faulty equipment.\n\nWe worked with AirWatt to build their system from scratch, teaming up with their business, hardware, and AI specialists. Our goal was to quickly develop a working product that would prove the concept worked, while also creating a strong foundation for future growth.\n\nWe needed to create a complete system that could collect data from monitoring devices, process it with AI, and show useful insights through easy-to-understand dashboards on different devices. The solution had to be both technically advanced and simple to use so it would provide real value to AirWatt's customers.\n\n## The challenge AirWatt was facing\n\nAirWatt needed a versatile system that could be installed quickly and improved over time. It had to work on multiple platforms and process large amounts of data in real-time.\n\n![AirWatt's business challenge](assets/airwatt-context.webp)\n\nThe main technical challenge was using AI to accurately figure out which electrical devices were turned on or off based on their power usage patterns. This required not just collecting and processing data, but also creating dashboards with tracking tools to visualize this information.\n\nWhile AirWatt had expertise in building hardware and developing AI algorithms, they needed a partner to help create the software that would connect everything and provide a user-friendly interface. They needed to establish the data structures and visualization tools that would make the platform valuable to users.\n\nThis was a complex challenge requiring expertise in connecting devices, processing data in real-time, integrating AI, and developing apps for different platforms – all areas where we could help.\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe approached the project by focusing on four key areas that aligned with AirWatt's business needs:\n\n1. **Device Management**: We created tools to manage monitoring devices across different locations, allowing users to see detailed usage information and control their monitors remotely.\n2. **Reporting**: We built features to track how electrical equipment is used, with mobile versions showing weekly or three-month history.\n3. **Mobile Apps**: We developed apps for iPhone and Android that let users connect monitors to their network and link them to their accounts.\n4. **Business Website**: We built a website for business owners to track data from their AirWatt monitors through weekly and monthly reports.\n\n![AirWatt's system design](assets/airwatt-architecture.webp)\n\n### Technical approach\n\nThe system had to handle huge amounts of data – each device generates about 17,280 records every day. To handle this, we built a system with specialized components:\n\n- **Core System**: The main service managing device lifecycles and data flow\n- **Landing Page**: A website showcasing solutions and allowing pre-orders\n- **Admin Dashboard**: Tools for system management and monitoring\n- **Mobile Apps**: iPhone and Android apps with dashboards, charts, and reports\n- **AI Engine**: The system's brain, handling data synchronization, device detection, prediction, and report generation\n- **Device Management**: The foundation for tracking device status and electricity consumption\n\nWe used different databases for specific purposes:\n\n- **MongoDB** for the main system, updating device status and electricity usage every 5 seconds\n- **DynamoDB** for storing AI input data, processed from the main system\n\nFor the AI models, we used real data from test users. The system collected device data over two-week periods to create reliable models for real-time detection and prediction.\n\n![AirWatt development process](assets/airwatt-collaboration.webp)\n\nTo connect hardware devices to the system, we implemented a WiFi connection method using the ESP2866 protocol, which requires pressing a button on the device to enable setup mode.\n\n### Technology we used\n\nWe selected a variety of technologies to build a reliable, scalable system:\n\n- **Backend**: Go for efficient processing of large data volumes\n- **Frontend**: React.js for web interfaces\n- **Mobile**: Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android) for native experiences\n- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, and Netlify\n- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, and DynamoDB\n- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, and Sentry\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nThroughout the project, we collaborated closely using tools like:\n\n- Figma for design collaboration\n- GitHub for code management\n- Insomnia for API testing and documentation\n\nWe followed agile development methods, regular code reviews, and automation practices to ensure high quality while maintaining development speed.\n\n## What we achieved\n\nAfter just three months of development, we successfully completed the working product with all necessary components:\n\n![AirWatt reporting dashboard](assets/airwatt-result1.webp)\n\n- **Apps for All Devices**: We delivered web applications for businesses and mobile apps for both [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airwatt/id1522009415) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dwarvesf.airwatt).\n- **Complete System**: We created a system that handles data from monitoring devices to the central server, processes it with AI, and shows the results on multiple platforms.\n- **Clear Reports**: We built attractive and information-rich data reports that provide actionable insights to users.\n\n![AirWatt solution overview](assets/airwatt-result2.webp)\n\n![AirWatt mobile app](assets/airwatt-result3.webp)\n\nThis successful implementation helped AirWatt prove their concept and gain recognition in the startup community, including being featured at [Vietnam Zone Startup](https://vietnam.zonestartups.com/zone-startups-portfolio/).\n\nFollowing this initial success, AirWatt has continued to grow, with their next goal being to customize the web application for restaurants and food businesses. This extension of their energy monitoring solution shows how the foundation we built is helping them expand into specific industries.\n","title":"Creating a smart system to monitor electricity Use","short_title":"AirWatt","description":"We built AirWatt's system that uses artificial intelligence to track how businesses use electricity, helping them save money and prevent equipment problems.","tags":["iot","case-study"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao","duy"],"date":"Sun Nov 15 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"consulting/case-study/airwatt.md","slugArray":["consulting","case-study","airwatt"]},{"content":"\n**Industry**\\\nMarketing Technology / Blockchain\n\n**Location**\\\nNetherlands\n\n**Business context**\\\nTraditional affiliate marketing systems lacked transparency and trust between merchants and websites\n\n**Solution**\\\nDeveloped a decentralized affiliate network using blockchain to verify referrals and ensure fair commission payments\n\n**Outcome**\\\nSuccessfully launched an MVP followed by \"The Outlet Launch\" (NFT cashback) and integration with major crypto exchanges\n\n**Our service**\\\nBlockchain Development / Smart Contract Development / Network Architecture\n\n## Technical highlights\n\n- **Smart contracts**: Solidity for transparent transaction agreements\n- **Backend**: Golang for blockchain data indexing and verifier network\n- **Consensus**: pBFT protocol implementation for blockchain validation\n- **Data storage**: IPFS for persistent, secure file sharing with access controls\n- **Security**: Multiple authentication systems with rigorous testing\n- **Integration**: Support for eight major blockchain networks\n\n## What we did with Attrace\n\nAttrace came to us with an exciting challenge: build a decentralized affiliate marketing network that uses blockchain to verify referrals and connect merchants with websites.\n\nTheir core idea was applying referral systems to different blockchain products, from token sales to NFTs.\n\nThey needed to launch an MVP quickly to validate their idea and start attracting early users. Our team of three developers joined their project, focusing on creating custom blockchain solutions to power Attrace's core functionality.\n\n![Attrace marketing platform overview](assets/attrace-platform-overview.webp)\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe focused on creating a secure, transparent system using blockchain technology:\n\n- **Blockchain solutions** for multiple use cases like IDO launches, liquidity pools, and NFTs\n- **Custom backend systems** built with Golang and Solidity to index blockchain data\n- **IPFS technology** for secure file sharing with proper access controls\n- **Privacy-focused design** meeting GDPR standards\n- **Fraud detection network** to verify transactions and prevent misuse\n\n## The problem Attrace was solving\n\nTraditional affiliate marketing has issues with transparency and trust. When a customer clicks a referral link and makes a purchase, it's hard to verify if the commission was correctly tracked and paid.\n\n![Attrace referral network diagram](assets/attrace-referral-network.webp)\n\nUnclear money flow creates opportunities for fraud. Attrace's solution was to move all network activity to blockchain, which provides:\n\n- Lower costs for running the network\n- Better data privacy management\n- Transparent tracking of all transactions\n\nThe blockchain system logs agreements between merchants and affiliates through smart contracts, with each click and conversion tracked on the chain.\n\n![Attrace app interface](assets/attrace-app-interface.webp)\n\n![Benefits of Attrace's approach](assets/attrace-benefits.webp)\n\nWe built Attrace using **blockchain nodes** that provide transparent transactions, create secure networks, and enable real-time communication between everyone involved.\n\n### Technical approach\n\nWe initially built on Ethereum because it offers a proven way to create decentralized applications with smart contracts. This greatly reduces the chance of fraud by eliminating the need for third parties.\n\nBut we didn't stop there. The Attrace team was already planning to integrate with more blockchain networks to reach a wider user base.\n\nWe developed several key technical components:\n\n- **Consensus protocol**: We implemented a pBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus mechanism for blockchain validation, ensuring reliable agreement between network nodes.\n- **Blockchain connector**: We built a network connector that serves as the interface for users to interact with Attrace's blockchain, simplifying the complexity of blockchain integration.\n- **Smart contract system**: We created Solidity contracts that define the rules for different types of affiliate relationships and handle commission payments automatically.\n- **Indexing engine**: We developed a system in Golang to efficiently index and process blockchain data, making it accessible for reporting and analysis.\n- **Dashboard**: We built a management interface for marketing campaigns, allowing users to create, track, and optimize their affiliate programs.\n\n### Data architecture\n\nBlockchain data needs to be available long-term while avoiding bloat. We used IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to keep data persistently available with proper access controls. This system relies on cryptographic hashes instead of storing everything on the blockchain itself.\n\nThis approach provided several benefits:\n\n- Data remains accessible even if the original publisher goes offline\n- Content addressing ensures data integrity\n- Access controls maintain privacy where needed\n- Reduced on-chain storage costs\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nWe stayed in sync with the Attrace team using Slack for daily conversations and Trello for task management.

It launched in 2019 with $2.6 million in funding from investors like Matchstick Ventures, Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, High Alpha Capital, and Slack Fund. Their goal was to change how executive assistants work.\n\nThe platform helps executive assistants manage their daily tasks by putting calendars, to-do lists, communication, and reporting all in one place. To do this, Base needed to build a system that could connect with all the different tools that assistants typically use.\n\n![BaseHQ assistant platform](assets/basehq-main.webp)\n\nWe worked with BaseHQ for two years to help them develop new features and improve existing ones. We focused on helping them meet their deadlines while keeping their product high-quality. We provided both development help and technical advice, helping them improve their code and system design as they grew.\n\n## The challenge BaseHQ was facing\n\nExecutive assistants have a unique challenge: they need to work across many different platforms and manage lots of information for the executives they support. Before Base, there wasn't any software specifically designed for their needs.\n\n![BaseHQ business context](assets/basehq-context.webp)\n\nBase needed to create an all-in-one platform that could bring together important data from different sources, including calendars, task managers, communication tools, and more. This would let assistants create reports, track decisions, build summaries for executives, and manage schedules all from one place.\n\nWhen we joined the project, Base had a lot of existing code that needed improvement to make the product more stable and ready for future growth. The challenge wasn't just to add new features but also to clean up existing code and create a better system that could support their ambitious plans.\n\n## How we built it\n\nOur work with BaseHQ included both coding and technical advice. We helped improve their existing code while suggesting new approaches for future features and providing design recommendations.\n\n### Technical approach\n\nWe tackled their large existing codebase and improved it to make the product more stable. The system was divided into two main parts:\n\n1. **User Application**: The interface that executive assistants use every day\n2. **Admin Tools**: Backend systems for managing users, connections, and platform settings\n\nFor the technical implementation, we used:\n\n- **Modern backend**: We combined Go and Node.js to create efficient APIs and data processing systems that could handle the complex requirements of calendar synchronization and task management.\n- **Type-safe frontend**: We built the user interfaces with React.js and Next.js, adding TypeScript to improve code quality and reduce bugs through static typing.\n- **Flexible database architecture**: We used MongoDB for storing unstructured data alongside PostgreSQL for more structured information, creating a hybrid approach that offered the best of both worlds.\n- **Reliable cloud infrastructure**: We deployed the system on Google Cloud Platform with Kubernetes, ensuring high availability and easy scaling as the user base grew.\n- **Comprehensive monitoring**: We implemented New Relic, Sentry, and Fullstory to track performance, catch errors, and understand user behavior.\n- **Event-driven architecture**: We created custom components for tracking events, enabling real-time updates and notifications across the platform.\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nOur collaboration with the Base team included:\n\n- Managing tasks through Jira to keep development organized\n- Communicating via Slack for quick questions and updates\n- Regular meetings on Zoom to discuss progress and challenges\n- Code management with Git for version control\n- Continuous deployment through GitHub Actions for reliable releases\n\nThroughout the project, we kept detailed weekly updates to track progress and ensure transparency with the BaseHQ team.\n\n## What we achieved\n\n![BaseHQ availability feature](assets/basehq-feature.webp)\n\nOne of the most important features we helped develop was the Availability Offer system, which combines calendar management with polling to make scheduling easier. This feature shows how Base simplifies complex workflows for executive assistants.\n\nThe availability system lets assistants:\n\n- Quickly find open time slots across multiple calendars\n- Send scheduling options to executives or external contacts\n- Collect preferences through a simple polling interface\n- Automatically book confirmed meetings on the right calendars\n\n![BaseHQ platform overview](assets/basehq-result1.webp)\n\n![BaseHQ user interface](assets/basehq-result2.webp)\n\n![BaseHQ dashboard](assets/basehq-result3.webp)\n\nOur partnership with Base is one of our longest collaborations. We've supported them through several important milestones, from the initial development of their web application to the creation and improvement of their core features.\n\nBase has continued to grow in popularity, recently showcasing their platform through a detailed [Base 101 Demo](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/basehq_base-101-demo-get-back-to-the-base-ics-activity-6800435873860120576-G7ZI) that shows how their system works.\n\nThis project illustrates the value of long-term technical partnerships in helping startups refine and expand their products. By providing both development resources and strategic technical guidance, we helped Base create a platform that addresses a significant market need and delivers tangible value to executive assistants worldwide.\n\nDwarves Foundation is a team of design and development experts working closely with clients to craft software, build tech teams, and invest in people who create world's next favorite things.\n","title":"Creating the first platform for Executive assistants","short_title":"BaseHQ","description":"We worked with BaseHQ for two years to build and improve their software for executive assistants, helping them create new features and make their system faster and more reliable.","tags":["startup","case-study","US"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["duy","nikki"],"date":"Fri Aug 06 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"consulting/case-study/basehq.md","slugArray":["consulting","case-study","basehq"]},{"content":"\n**Industry**\\\nTransportation / Ride-hailing\n\n**Location**\\\nVietnam\n\n**Business context**\\\nbeGroup needed to launch their enterprise ride-hailing service on a tight timeline while their in-house team was focused on their core consumer app\n\n**Solution**\\\nProvided an augmented team of six developers to accelerate the development of the beCorporate platform\n\n**Outcome**\\\nSuccessfully released the beCorporate MVP after just three months, expanding beGroup's market coverage\n\n**Our service**\\\nTeam Augmentation / Backend Development / Frontend Development\n\n## Technical highlights\n\n- **Backend**: Golang development for scalability and performance\n- **Frontend**: ReactJS with Tailwind for modern, responsive interfaces\n- **Architecture**: Microservices approach for seamless integration\n- **DevOps**: Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and CI/CD pipeline\n- **Process**: Agile development using Scrum methodology\n- **Collaboration**: Close integration with the beGroup in-house team\n\n![beGroup ride-hailing service](assets/begroup-main.webp)\n\n## What we did with beGroup\n\nbeGroup is one of Vietnam's leading ride-hailing platforms, backed by significant early funding of over $40 million. With ambitious plans to launch four distinct products by the end of 2018, they faced a challenging timeline with just six months until their debut.\n\nOne of these products was beCorporate, a specialized module designed to help enterprises manage and optimize their business transportation needs for employees. While beGroup's in-house engineering team was fully occupied with developing their core consumer ride-hailing app, they needed additional expertise to deliver beCorporate on schedule.\n\nWe provided an augmented team of six developers who worked collaboratively with beGroup to accelerate the development of beCorporate, helping them complete their product lineup and strengthen their market position in Vietnam's competitive transportation industry.\n\n## The challenge beGroup was facing\n\nbeCorporate is specifically tailored for enterprise clients, allowing employees to register, schedule, and book vehicles for business travel through the beApp platform, either individually or as groups. The initial launch of beGroup's main service had already gained significant traction and traffic, putting their development team under considerable pressure.\n\n![beGroup's market context](assets/begroup-context.webp)\n\nThe release timeline for beCorporate was fixed due to the company's business roadmap. The market had responded positively to their main app and was eager to see more offerings from the beGroup platform.\n\nIn 2018, building an in-house team of experienced Golang developers on short notice was particularly challenging in Vietnam. With their tight timeline, beGroup needed a partner who could hit the ground running. Traditional hiring wasn't viable – there simply wasn't enough time for recruitment, onboarding, or technical training.\n\nAs beGroup noted: \"We were one of the first teams in Vietnam that picked up Golang as the strategic language. That's how our partnership began.\"\n\n## How we built it\n\nThe first challenge was determining the best architectural approach for beCorporate. We explored two potential options:\n\n1. A standalone solution: This would provide a modern enterprise service without compromising stability and reliability\n2. Integration with beGroup's ecosystem: This would ensure beCorporate fit seamlessly into their existing infrastructure\n\n![beGroup's architecture decision](assets/begroup-architecture.webp)\n\nAfter careful analysis, we determined that integrating beCorporate into the existing ecosystem made more strategic sense. This approach would allow users to seamlessly experience other beGroup services and create a more cohesive product family. A microservices architecture became our chosen technical approach to accomplish this goal.\n\n### Technical approach\n\nWe implemented a solution utilizing:\n\n- **Backend development**: We used Golang to ensure scalability and performance, making sure the system could handle enterprise-level demands.\n- **Modern frontend**: We built the user interface with ReactJS and Tailwind, creating a responsive design that worked well on all devices.\n- **Comprehensive monitoring**: We implemented logging and monitoring systems to track performance and quickly identify any issues.\n- **Efficient deployment**: We set up an automated CI/CD pipeline for reliable testing and deployment, ensuring consistent quality.\n- **Seamless integration**: We carefully designed the system to work within beGroup's existing ecosystem while maintaining its own distinct functionality.\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nThroughout the project, we maintained close collaboration with the beGroup team through:\n\n- Regular communication via Slack and GSuite document sharing\n- Task management through Jira\n- Agile development using Scrum methodology\n- Bi-weekly release iterations and weekly technical discussions\n\nThis approach ensured alignment with beGroup's vision while maintaining development velocity.\n\n## What we achieved\n\nOur collaboration delivered significant results. The first MVP of beCorporate was successfully released after just three months of development, expanding beGroup's market coverage and strengthening their position in Vietnam's transportation industry.\n\n![beCorporate service results](assets/begroup-result1.webp)\n\n![beCorporate interface](assets/begroup-result2.webp)\n\n![beCorporate mobile app](assets/begroup-result3.webp)\n\nThe team augmentation model provided several important benefits for beGroup:\n\n- Reduced recruitment and training costs during a critical growth period\n- Allowed them to focus their internal resources on product development and maintenance\n- Enabled them to invest more in marketing strategy and brand-building activities\n- Delivered a complete enterprise offering to complement their consumer services\n\nThis project demonstrated the effectiveness of strategic team augmentation for companies facing tight deadlines with specialized technical requirements. By providing experienced Golang developers who could integrate quickly with beGroup's existing team, we helped them achieve their business objectives and establish a strong foundation for future growth in the enterprise transportation market.\n","title":"Helping launch beCorporate enterprise ride-hailing service","short_title":"beGroup","description":"We provided an augmented team for beGroup, Vietnam's popular ride-hailing platform, to help them launch their beCorporate enterprise service on a tight timeline while their in-house team focused on their core consumer app.","tags":["ride-hailing","case-study"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["duy"],"date":"Wed Nov 18 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"consulting/case-study/begroup.md","slugArray":["consulting","case-study","begroup"]},{"content":"\n**Industry**\\\nEntertainment\n\n**Location**\\\nVietnam\n\n**Business context**\\\nPopular cinema chain with an outdated, non-functional mobile app that frustrated users\n\n**Solution**\\\nComplete app redesign with intuitive user flows for booking tickets and discovering movies\n\n**Outcome**\\\nA modern, easy-to-use app that lets movie-goers book tickets online and enhances the cinema experience\n\n**Our service**\\\nMobile app design / UI/UX improvement\n\n## Technical highlights\n\n- **UI Framework**: Used modern mobile design frameworks\n- **Typography**: Avenir Next font family for clean, readable text\n- **Design System**: Created consistent components and color palette\n- **Interactive Elements**: Carousel navigation, intuitive booking screens\n\n## What we did with BHD Cinema\n\nBHD Cinema is one of Vietnam's largest cinema chains, selling hundreds of thousands of tickets each month. Despite their popularity, their mobile app was a major weak point in their customer experience. The old app looked outdated, had an inconsistent interface, and most importantly, didn't allow customers to book tickets online.\n\nWe completely redesigned their app to meet the basic needs of movie-goers in a clean, intuitive way. Our new design makes it easy for customers to check movie schedules, see what's playing, learn about films, and book tickets directly through the app.\n\n![BHD Cinema's new app main screen showing movie listings and promotions](assets/bhd-main.webp)\n\n## The challenge BHD faced\n\nBHD needed to change how customers perceived their digital experience. Their existing app was:\n\n- Visually outdated and inconsistent\n- Unable to process online ticket bookings\n- Difficult to navigate with a cluttered interface\n- Missing key information that customers needed\n\nThey wanted a solution that would not only allow online booking but would also help convert regular movie-goers into loyal BHD customers. The app needed to become their customers' first choice when thinking about watching a movie.\n\n![User personas for BHD Cinema app showing typical customer profiles](assets/bhd-personas.webp)\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe approached the redesign by focusing on the core needs of movie-goers while creating a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate experience.\n\n### Design approach\n\nWe built the app around several key principles:\n\n**Intuitive navigation**: We designed the home screen to immediately show what movies are playing, with a smooth carousel interface that makes browsing enjoyable. We moved promotional content below the movies to keep the focus on the main task—finding and booking movies.\n\n**Simplified information**: Movie details are structured for easy scanning, with all the essential information (runtime, genre, ratings) clearly visible. A persistent \"Book now\" button stays at the bottom of the screen, making it easy to move to the booking process at any point.\n\n**Streamlined booking**: The booking flow was reduced to the minimum necessary steps, with clear visual cues at each stage. We grouped showtimes logically by date, location, and theater type to help users quickly find convenient options.\n\n**Digital convenience**: We introduced digital tickets with QR codes, allowing for faster entry at theaters and reducing paper waste. The app also keeps track of past bookings and ticket history, sorted from newest to oldest for easy access.\n\n### Design elements\n\nWe created a consistent design system for the app:\n\n**Typography**: We used Avenir Next throughout the app for its excellent readability and modern feel.\n\n![Typography examples showing Avenir Next font in different weights and sizes](assets/bhd-typography.webp)\n\n**Color palette**: We developed a color system based on BHD's brand colors, creating a visually appealing interface that maintained brand recognition.\n\n![Color palette showing the main colors used in the BHD app design](assets/bhd-colors.webp)\n\n### Key features\n\n**Home screen and movie schedule**: The redesigned home screen makes it easy to see what's playing with larger movie cards and a smoother carousel effect. We prioritized movie content over promotional banners to focus on the main user need.\n\n![Home screen design showing movie listings in carousel format](assets/bhd-home.webp)\n\n**Movie details**: We structured movie information to help users quickly decide if a film matches their interests. Details include synopsis, runtime, genre, cast, and age rating—all the essential information for making a choice.\n\n![Movie details screen showing film information and booking button](assets/bhd-details.webp)\n\n**Showtime selection**: We organized showtimes in a logical order by date, location, and theater type. Only relevant information is highlighted to prevent information overload:\n\n- Today's date is the default view (you can't book past shows)\n- City selection is simplified\n- Start times are arranged in a horizontal scroll for quick scanning\n\n![Showtime selection screen with organized viewing options](assets/bhd-showtime.webp)\n\n**Booking flow**: We simplified the entire booking process to make it quick and intuitive, reducing the steps needed to complete a reservation.\n\n![Booking flow showing the seat selection process](assets/bhd-booking.webp)\n\n**Transaction history and tickets**: The app keeps track of all tickets and orders, making it easy for users to access their current and past bookings. Digital tickets include QR codes for quick theater entry.\n\n![Ticket history screen showing past bookings and digital tickets](assets/bhd-history.webp)\n\n**Cinema browsing**: For users who prefer to choose a theater first, we created a \"Book by cinema\" feature that shows all movies playing at a specific location. This option provides greater flexibility in how users approach their movie selection.\n\n![Cinema selection screen showing theater options and films playing](assets/bhd-by-cinema.webp)\n\n**Theater information**: The app includes detailed information about each BHD theater, including photos of the different theater types (standard, premium, etc.) to help customers know what to expect from their cinema experience.\n\n![Theater information screen showing different cinema types](assets/bhd-theaters.webp)\n\n## What we achieved\n\nThe redesigned BHD Cinema app successfully transformed the customer experience by addressing all the key issues with the previous version:\n\n- Created an intuitive interface that makes finding and booking movies simple\n- Implemented online ticket booking functionality that eliminates the need to wait in line\n- Designed a system for managing digital tickets and booking history\n- Provided comprehensive information about movies, theaters, and showtimes in an easily digestible format\n- Built a flexible platform that accommodates different user approaches to movie selection\n\nThe new app helps BHD Cinema strengthen their brand and build customer loyalty by providing a seamless digital experience that complements their physical cinema services. By making it easier for customers to engage with their brand through digital channels, BHD can better compete in Vietnam's busy entertainment market.\n","title":"Redesigning BHD Cinema's ticket booking app for a better experience","short_title":"BHD Cinema","description":"We helped BHD Cinema transform their outdated mobile app into an intuitive platform that allows customers to easily browse movies, book tickets online, and enjoy a seamless cinema experience—turning movie-goers into loyal BHD fans.","tags":["case-study"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["duy"],"date":"Wed May 20 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"consulting/case-study/bhd.md","slugArray":["consulting","case-study","bhd"]},{"content":"\n**Industry**\\\nBanking and finance\n\n**Location**\\\nSoutheast Asia\n\n**Business context**\\\nNeeded to modernize wealth management services as part of digital transformation\n\n**Solution**\\\nBuilt a backend system that connects new customer-facing platform with legacy systems\n\n**Outcome**\\\nSuccessfully launched a streamlined digital investment platform that improved user experience and operational efficiency\n\n**Our service**\\\nTech consulting / Staff augmentation\n\n## What we did with CIMB\n\nWe helped CIMB Malaysia, one of Southeast Asia's leading banks, create a modern digital platform for their wealth management services. Our team focused specifically on building the backend foundation that connects their new customer-facing application with their existing banking systems.\n\nThe project was part of CIMB's larger digital transformation initiative aimed at improving how customers manage their investments, particularly through their ASNB (Amanah Saham Nasional Berhad) investment products. By making these services more accessible digitally, CIMB could better serve both their preferred and mass-affluent customers.\n\nWorking alongside CIMB's team and our partner Netizen, we delivered the technical backbone that powers this new digital experience, helping the bank set new standards in Malaysia's digital banking landscape.\n\n![CIMB's digital wealth management platform interface](assets/cimb-wealth-platform.webp)\n\n## Technical highlights\n\nOur work centered on creating robust backend systems that could reliably connect CIMB's new platform with their existing infrastructure:\n\n- **Java Spring Boot**: We used this framework for building the core backend services\n- **MySQL**: For database management and data storage\n- **API Gateway**: We built a custom gateway to manage communication between different systems\n- **Legacy Integration**: Developed connectors to work with CIMB's existing databases and APIs\n\nThis technical approach ensured the new platform would work reliably while maintaining compatibility with the bank's established systems.\n\n## The challenge CIMB faced\n\nCIMB Malaysia needed to keep pace with rapidly changing customer expectations in banking. Their existing wealth management services weren't meeting the digital-first demands of modern customers.\n\nThe main challenges included:\n\n- Their investment processes required too many manual steps and branch visits\n- Customers couldn't easily track or manage their investments through digital channels\n- Relationship managers lacked efficient digital tools to help their clients\n- Legacy banking systems made it difficult to create new digital experiences\n\nThe bank needed a solution that would make investment management simpler and more accessible for customers while working seamlessly with their existing backend systems.\n\n## How we built it\n\nOur approach focused on creating solid backend foundations that would support CIMB's customer-facing improvements.\n\n### Technical approach\n\nWe concentrated on two key areas:\n\n**API Gateway Construction**: We built a flexible API gateway that serves as the communication hub between different parts of the system. This gateway manages data flow between the customer-facing application and CIMB's core banking systems, ensuring secure and efficient information exchange.\n\n**Legacy System Integration**: We created custom connectors that allow the new platform to work with CIMB's existing databases and APIs. This was crucial for maintaining data consistency and ensuring that customer information remained accurate across all systems.\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nWorking on a project with multiple stakeholders required careful coordination. We established a clear communication structure:\n\n1. **Quick team formation**: We rapidly assembled a team of senior engineers from our talent network who had the right skills for this financial project.\n2. **Three-party collaboration**: The project involved Dwarves, Netizen (design partner), and CIMB's team working together.

Think of it like a currency exchange for digital money, except it works across multiple crypto systems.\n\nAs different blockchain networks like Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance grew in popularity, users needed a way to move their digital assets between these systems. Moving crypto between networks was slow, complicated, and often expensive.\n\nWe built a solution that makes these transfers simple, fast, and cost-effective. Our platform lets users:\n\n- Move tokens between different blockchain networks\n- Find the best rates for their exchanges\n- Complete transfers in just 15 seconds (much faster than the industry standard)\n- Earn rewards by providing liquidity to the system\n\nWhat makes our solution special is that we created a system that connects these different networks securely while keeping transactions fast and affordable.\n\n![iCrosschain platform interface showing cross-chain token transfers](assets/spike-main.webp)\n\n## The challenge iCrosschain solved\n\nMoving cryptocurrency between different blockchain networks has long been a significant pain point for users. Each blockchain operates as its own isolated ecosystem with unique rules, assets, and security models.\n\n### Technical limitations of cross-chain transfers\n\nTraditional methods for moving assets between blockchains faced several critical challenges:\n\n- **Time delays**: Transfers typically took minutes or even hours to complete\n- **High costs**: Users paid excessive fees, especially during periods of network congestion\n- **Complex processes**: Moving assets required multiple steps across different platforms\n- **Security concerns**: Cross-chain bridges were frequent targets for hacks and exploits\n- **Limited options**: Many smaller blockchains had few or no reliable bridging solutions\n\nThese challenges created significant friction in the crypto ecosystem. As decentralized finance (DeFi) applications grew across multiple blockchains, users increasingly needed to move assets efficiently between networks to take advantage of different opportunities.\n\n![Crypto transfer challenges diagram showing network isolation problems](assets/spike-interface.webp)\n\nThe biggest technical challenge was creating a system that could maintain security while dramatically improving speed. Most existing solutions prioritized one at the expense of the other, forcing users to choose between waiting hours for a secure transfer or using faster but riskier alternatives.\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe approached this challenge by rethinking the fundamental architecture of cross-chain transfers. Our goal was to create a solution that offered both security and speed without compromise.\n\n### Technical approach\n\n**Optimized consensus mechanism**: We developed a specialized consensus system that validates transactions across different blockchains much faster than conventional methods. This mechanism:\n\n- Verifies transaction authenticity using a network of validators\n- Processes transfers in parallel rather than sequentially\n- Implements optimistic confirmation for common transaction patterns\n- Uses specialized cryptographic proofs to maintain security\n\n**Smart contract architecture**: We built a system of interconnected smart contracts across multiple blockchains using Solidity. These contracts:\n\n- Lock tokens on the source chain\n- Mint or release equivalent tokens on the destination chain\n- Maintain a synchronized state across all connected networks\n- Implement security measures to prevent double-spending\n\n**Liquidity optimization**: We created a network of liquidity pools that:\n\n- Reduce reliance on direct token bridges\n- Find the most efficient path for asset transfers\n- Minimize transaction fees (gas costs)\n- Incentivize liquidity providers through reward tokens\n\n**User-centered design**: We developed an intuitive interface using React.js and Next.js that:\n\n- Simplifies the complex process of cross-chain transfers\n- Automatically suggests the best routing options\n- Provides clear status updates during transfers\n- Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices\n\n**Security prioritization**: We implemented multiple layers of security:\n\n- Multi-signature authentication for critical operations\n- Rigorous smart contract auditing and testing\n- Rate limiting to prevent abuse\n- Continuous monitoring for suspicious activities\n\n![iCrosschain platform architecture diagram showing system components](assets/spike-platform.webp)\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nWe approached this project with the mindset of building our own startup:\n\n- **Deep domain expertise**: Our team immersed ourselves in blockchain technology, becoming specialists in cross-chain protocols and token standards\n- **Ownership mentality**: We treated the project as our own business, making decisions with long-term success in mind\n- **Collaborative innovation**: We worked closely with the client, exchanging ideas and collectively solving complex technical challenges\n- **Iterative development**: We used a phased approach, starting with core functionality and expanding to additional features and blockchain networks\n\nOur development process leveraged:\n\n- GitHub for version control and code review\n- Basecamp for project management and communication\n- Jira for tracking development tasks and bugs\n- Regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities\n\nThis approach enabled us to build a sophisticated platform while maintaining the agility needed to adapt to the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem.\n\n## What we achieved\n\nWe're proud of what we accomplished with iCrosschain. The platform we built achieved several significant milestones:\n\n**Industry-leading speed**: We created the fastest cross-chain exchange in the cryptocurrency market, completing transfers in just 15 seconds compared to the minutes or hours required by competitors.\n\n**Multi-chain compatibility**: We successfully connected 8 major blockchain networks:\n\n- Ethereum\n- Binance Smart Chain\n- Polygon\n- Fantom\n- Avalanche\n- Arbitrum\n- Heco chain\n- Okex chain\n- (with Solana integration in development)\n\n**Token ecosystem**: We launched two native tokens that power the platform:\n\n- ICC token: Used for governance and staking\n- iPlus token: Provides additional features and rewards\n\n**Decentralized exchange expansion**: We deployed a specialized DEX on the Avalanche network, with plans to expand to additional chains.\n\n**Market presence**: We successfully listed our tokens on major exchanges including Pancake Swap, making them widely accessible to users.\n\n![iCrosschain tokens showing the platform's native cryptocurrency](assets/spike-tokens.webp)\n\n### Real-world impact\n\nThe iCrosschain platform has transformed how cryptocurrency users move their assets between networks:\n\n- **For traders**: Enabled quick response to market opportunities across different blockchains\n- **For developers**: Provided reliable infrastructure to build cross-chain applications\n- **For investors**: Simplified portfolio management across multiple networks\n- **For the ecosystem**: Increased liquidity and connectivity between previously isolated blockchains\n\nThe platform currently operates with centralized validators to ensure security, with plans to deploy validators to partners for greater decentralization. We're also continuing to develop and enhance the decentralized exchange on Avalanche, with completion expected soon.\n\nBy creating a solution that bridges the gaps between different blockchain networks, iCrosschain has helped advance the vision of a more interconnected and user-friendly cryptocurrency ecosystem where assets can flow freely regardless of their native blockchain.\n","title":"Making crypto transfers faster and easier","short_title":"iCrosschain","description":"We built iCrosschain, a platform that helps crypto users move their digital assets between different blockchain networks quickly and easily.

Para, a healthcare staffing platform founded in 2019, needed to launch quickly to help address this crisis.\n\nWe partnered with Para through our COVID-19 support program, which we launched in early 2020 to help startups navigate the challenges of the pandemic. This program provided technical expertise at reduced rates to businesses working on essential services.\n\nOur team helped Para complete their MVP development, focusing on key features like shift management and candidate screening. We stepped in at a crucial moment, taking on technical challenges so Para could focus on their business growth during a time when their service was desperately needed.\n\n![Para healthcare staffing platform showing the nurse-hospital matching interface](assets/para-platform.webp)\n\n## The problem Para was solving\n\nHospitals have always struggled with staffing challenges, but COVID-19 made the situation critical. Medical professionals were in high demand, and traditional staffing methods were too slow for the rapidly changing needs of healthcare facilities.\n\nThe pandemic created unprecedented pressures on the healthcare system:\n\n- Hospitals experienced sudden surges in patient numbers\n- Staff members were becoming ill and unable to work\n- Burnout increased as healthcare workers faced overwhelming conditions\n- Traditional staffing agencies couldn't respond quickly enough\n- Qualified nurses were available but lacked efficient ways to find shifts\n\nPara saw a clear opportunity to help by creating a direct connection between qualified nurses and the hospitals that needed them most urgently. Their platform would eliminate the middleman, speed up the matching process, and help address the staffing crisis at a crucial time.\n\n![How Para works diagram showing the staffing workflow](assets/para-workflow.webp)\n\nThis is where we came in. Para needed a team that could quickly build reliable software to handle complex workflows and large volumes of data. Speed was essential - the sooner they could launch, the more help they could provide during the crisis.\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe took a practical, focused approach to help Para launch quickly while building a foundation that could scale with their growth:\n\n### Technical approach\n\n**Microservices architecture**: We built a system in Go that provided both reliability and performance. This architecture:\n\n- Separated different business functions into independent services\n- Allowed for targeted scaling of high-demand components\n- Improved fault isolation to maintain overall system stability\n- Enabled faster feature development in parallel\n\n**Message-oriented middleware**: We implemented RabbitMQ to handle asynchronous processing, which:\n\n- Managed background tasks without affecting user experience\n- Enabled reliable communication between services\n- Provided a buffer during traffic spikes\n- Ensured important operations weren't lost if a service went down\n\n**Optimized database performance**: We wrote raw SQL queries instead of using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to gain:\n\n- Better control over query execution\n- Improved performance for complex data operations\n- More efficient use of database resources\n- Reduced latency for critical operations\n\n**Cloud-native deployment**: Using Kubernetes on Google Cloud (GKE) gave us:\n\n- Automatic scaling to handle variable load\n- Self-healing capabilities to recover from failures\n- Consistent deployment across environments\n- Better resource utilization\n\n**Advanced matching algorithm**: We created a sophisticated system to match healthcare workers with shifts based on multiple criteria:\n\n- Credentials and specializations\n- Location and travel preferences\n- Availability and scheduling constraints\n- Facility requirements\n- Previous experience and ratings\n\n**Comprehensive quality assurance**: We implemented automated regression testing and used Codecov to ensure complete test coverage, maintaining reliability even with rapid development.\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nWe assembled a flexible team structure that evolved with the project's needs:\n\n**Initial phase**: A senior backend engineer worked closely with Para's team to build the core system and implement the complex business logic that powered the matching service.\n\n**Design phase**: As the backend foundation took shape, our design director and UI designer joined to improve the mobile app interface. They created designs in Figma and Sketch that worked effectively on both iOS and Android.\n\n**Frontend implementation**: Next, a frontend engineer turned those designs into functional interfaces using React, ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms.\n\n**Project oversight**: Throughout the project, our project manager provided coordination and business guidance, helping align our technical work with Para's goals.\n\nThis team of five maintained close communication with Para's leadership, adapting to changing requirements while keeping development on track for a timely launch.\n\nOur communication approach emphasized clarity and efficiency:\n\n- Slack and Google Meet for daily team discussions\n- Figma for collaborative design work\n- Git with proper Gitflow practices for code management\n- Jira, Statushero, and Confluence for comprehensive task tracking\n\nThis communication structure helped us maintain alignment with Para despite the challenging circumstances of the pandemic and remote work.\n\n![Para app homepage showing the main dashboard](assets/para-homepage.webp)\n\n## What we achieved\n\nAfter six months of focused development, we helped Para launch their MVP on schedule - a fully functional app for managing nurse shift schedules. The platform successfully connected healthcare facilities with qualified nursing professionals at a time when this service was critically needed.\n\nThe key achievements included:\n\n**Functional MVP launch**: We delivered a complete, polished application that was ready for client demonstrations and initial user onboarding.\n\n**Reduced development timeline**: Our expertise helped Para significantly accelerate their development process, bringing their solution to market months earlier than would otherwise have been possible.\n\n**Critical pandemic support**: By connecting nursing professionals with vacant hospital shifts, Para made a meaningful contribution to the COVID-19 response.\n\n**Foundation for growth**: The architecture we built provided Para with a solid technical foundation that could scale as their business grew.\n\n![Para signup flow showing the user onboarding process](assets/para-signup.webp)\n\nThe platform included several key features that set it apart from traditional staffing solutions:\n\n- Streamlined verification process for healthcare credentials\n- Real-time shift matching based on qualifications and availability\n- Direct communication between facilities and professionals\n- Simplified scheduling and shift management\n- Secure handling of sensitive healthcare information\n\nPara's CEO expressed their satisfaction with our partnership: \"Dwarves Foundation's communication skills are exceptional as well as their integrity.

Together, we built a new app that matched Kafi's goal of \"Building financial dreams\" and helping everyone access investment opportunities.\n\nOur main task was designing an app that works for two very different groups: beginners who are just starting to invest, and professionals who trade stocks daily. The app needed to teach new Vietnamese investors about finance while giving experienced traders the advanced tools they need.\n\nInstead of making small improvements to their old app, we built something completely new from scratch. This fresh start let us make the app faster, more secure, and easier to use.\n\n![Kafi Securities mobile trading app interface showing market data](assets/kafi-cover.png)\n\n## The challenge Kafi faced\n\nKafi's biggest problem was that their old app didn't work well for different types of users. This caused several key challenges:\n\n### User experience problems\n\n- **High dropout rates during onboarding**: The complicated identity verification process turned potential users away, with many abandoning the app before completing registration\n- **Confusion for new investors**: Financial terminology and complex charts overwhelmed beginners, preventing them from taking their first steps\n- **Limited tools for professionals**: Experienced traders couldn't access the detailed market analysis they needed on mobile devices\n- **One-size-fits-all approach**: The app treated everyone the same way, regardless of experience level\n\n### Business impact\n\nThese user experience issues directly affected Kafi's business by:\n\n- Limiting new user acquisition despite marketing efforts\n- Reducing mobile engagement - users only checked basic information instead of actively trading\n- Pushing professional traders to use desktop platforms or competitor apps\n- Creating frustration that damaged the company's reputation\n\nWith investment interest growing in Vietnam, Kafi recognized the opportunity to capture market share by creating a more accessible platform. However, they needed to better understand their users' needs before they could build an effective solution.\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe used a three-step approach: learn, plan, and design. This methodical process helped us understand what users truly needed before we started creating solutions.\n\n### Technical approach\n\n#### Comprehensive user research\n\nWe spent an intensive week gathering insights to answer three critical questions: What frustrates customers now? What do they want? What do they actually need?\n\nOur research methodology included:\n\n- **Contextual observation**: We watched real users interact with the app to identify moments of frustration and confusion\n- **Social listening**: We analyzed investment forums and social media groups to uncover common problems discussed by traders\n- **Competitive analysis**: We evaluated competing trading apps to identify best practices and opportunities for differentiation\n\nThis research revealed that most mobile trading app users primarily want to:\n\n- Monitor stock prices and market news quickly\n- Check their account balances and positions\n- Receive alerts about important market changes or opportunities\n- Execute basic trades when away from their computers\n\n#### Experience-based personalization\n\nBased on our research findings, we created user personas and journey maps to guide our design decisions. This led us to develop a core innovation: experience-based personalization.\n\nThe app now identifies whether a user is a beginner, intermediate, or expert investor and adjusts the interface accordingly:\n\n- **Beginners** see simplified views with educational components\n- **Intermediate users** access more detailed charts and analysis tools\n- **Advanced traders** get professional-grade features and customization options\n\n![Different app views for different experience levels showing persona-based interfaces](assets/kafi-designing-tools-for-different-user-groups.png)\n\n#### Streamlined onboarding process\n\nWe completely redesigned the registration process by:\n\n- Breaking it into smaller, more manageable steps\n- Adding a clear progress indicator to show completion status\n- Allowing users to explore the app before completing full verification\n- Implementing a \"try before you buy\" approach with demo accounts\n\n#### Education integration\n\nFor new investors, we created contextual learning tools:\n\n- Hover tooltips that explain financial terms in plain language\n- A persistent help panel that can be accessed from any screen\n- Interactive tutorials that guide users through their first trades\n- Simplified market explanations with visual aids\n\n![Help features for new investors showing contextual assistance](assets/kafi-helping-new-investors.png)\n\n![Investment education tools showing simplified explanations](assets/kafi-helping-new-investors-2.png)\n\n#### Modern, minimalist design system\n\nWe developed a clean, distraction-free interface that puts important information first:\n\n- Eliminated unnecessary elements to reduce cognitive load\n- Used consistent design patterns across all sections\n- Implemented a contemporary color scheme with clear hierarchy\n- Created flexible components that work across different screens\n\n![Design concepts for the app interface showing visual style exploration](assets/kafi-moodboard.png)\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nOur partnership with Kafi involved close collaboration throughout the project:\n\n- Regular workshops with stakeholders to align on direction\n- Weekly progress reviews with their leadership team\n- User testing sessions with actual Kafi customers\n- Direct collaboration with their development team\n- Knowledge transfer sessions to ensure smooth implementation\n\nThis collaborative approach ensured the final product would meet both business objectives and user needs while being technically feasible to implement.\n\n## What we achieved\n\nOur redesign of Kafi's trading app delivered several measurable improvements:\n\n**Increased registration completions**: The streamlined onboarding process helped more people successfully join the platform, with completion rates rising significantly.\n\n**Higher mobile engagement**: Both beginners and professionals now spend more time using the app, with more trades being executed on mobile.\n\n**Accelerated learning curve**: New investors reported feeling more confident and began trading earlier in their journey thanks to the integrated educational tools.\n\n**Advanced functionality**: Professional traders gained access to the detailed analysis tools they needed, reducing their reliance on desktop platforms.\n\n**Unified platform experience**: A single app now effectively serves users at all experience levels, simplifying maintenance while improving the user experience.\n\n**Enhanced brand perception**: The modern, thoughtful design strengthened Kafi's position as an innovative investment platform in Vietnam.\n\nThe new app successfully supports Kafi's mission to make investing accessible to everyone while providing experienced traders with the tools they need.

Beer kegs are valuable assets that frequently go missing, costing breweries significant money each year. Konvoy wanted to create a tech-driven rental system that would solve this problem.\n\nWe partnered with them to build a platform that provides real-time keg tracking and analytics. This system helps breweries maintain visibility of their assets throughout the supply chain, reducing losses and improving their bottom line.\n\nBy combining modern tracking technology with flexible rental options, Konvoy offers breweries a compelling alternative to purchasing and managing their own kegs. Their solution helps customers save money while gaining better insights into their keg utilization and movement patterns.\n\n![Konvoy keg tracking system showing asset locations on a digital map](assets/konvoy-main.webp)\n\n## The challenge Konvoy was solving\n\nBreweries face a common challenge: kegs frequently disappear in their supply chain. Traditional tracking methods are manual and inefficient, leading to lost assets and wasted money.\n\nFor breweries, these losses represent a significant expense:\n\n- Each keg costs hundreds of dollars to replace\n- Manual tracking systems are labor-intensive and error-prone\n- Limited visibility makes it difficult to identify where losses occur\n- Inventory management becomes increasingly complex as a brewery grows\n\nKonvoy launched in Australia and New Zealand in October 2019 to address this issue. By October 2020, they had integrated comprehensive keg services into their business, combining innovative technology with industry expertise.\n\nTheir solution offers breweries flexible options:\n\n- Short-term keg rentals for one-way trips with transparent pricing\n- Long-term leasing that frees up capital businesses would otherwise spend on buying kegs\n\nWith a focused mission to track every keg's location, Konvoy helps breweries reduce losses and increase profits. Their team of 30 professionals provides exceptional service and maintenance, minimizing keg downtime.\n\nTo make this business model work effectively, Konvoy needed a robust technical platform that could reliably track thousands of kegs across multiple locations while providing easy-to-understand data for both their team and their customers.\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe created a robust technology platform that could handle the complex requirements of real-time keg tracking and management.

They needed to quickly develop and launch their first MVP—a web platform that would serve as a centralized hub for F\u0026B merchants to manage their online presence across multiple services.\n\nWith a tight timeline to test their market fit and onboard early users, Momos needed additional development expertise. We provided a team of three developers who worked remotely with Momos starting in March 2021. Our goal was not only to accelerate their development timeline but also to establish a solid technical foundation that would support future growth and scalability.\n\nTogether, we built a platform that integrates with third-party delivery services, manages online reputation, runs targeted social ads, and generates content-based reports—all from a single dashboard.\n\n![Momos F\u0026B platform dashboard showing integrated services](assets/momos-main.webp)\n\n## The challenge Momos was facing\n\nAs more F\u0026B businesses moved their operations online during the pandemic, many faced a common challenge: they needed to work with multiple service providers to establish their digital presence. This fragmentation created inefficiencies and complications for businesses that just wanted to focus on their core product—food.\n\nThe typical restaurant or café had to manage:\n\n- Multiple food delivery platforms (Grab, Foodpanda, Deliveroo)\n- Various social media accounts\n- Online reviews across different platforms\n- Digital advertising campaigns\n- Sales data from multiple sources\n\nThis fragmentation meant restaurant owners spent more time juggling different platforms than focusing on their actual business. They lacked a unified view of their online operations and struggled to make data-driven decisions.\n\nMomos aimed to solve this problem by creating a centralized data hub that would handle these integrations, allowing businesses to manage everything from a single platform. The founders had a clear vision for expanding their integration capabilities but needed technical expertise to make it happen quickly.\n\n![Momos context diagram showing the fragmented F\u0026B digital ecosystem](assets/momos-context.webp)\n\nWorking with an early-stage startup meant embracing a rapidly changing environment. As the technical partner, we needed to deeply understand their business model and contribute meaningfully to building a future-proof foundation during these critical early stages.\n\n## How we built it\n\nIn the fast-paced startup environment, we knew that speed and flexibility would be essential. We deployed resources who could take ownership of their work, understand the product vision, and communicate effectively with the Momos team.\n\n### Technical approach\n\nThe platform we built functions as a centralized data hub with several key features:\n\n**Third-party integrations**: We developed connections to major food delivery platforms (Grab, Foodpanda, and Deliveroo) and mapped their APIs to the Facebook platform. This allowed Momos to pull data from these services and present it in a unified dashboard.\n\n**Serverless architecture**: We built the platform on AWS using serverless technologies like Lambda, EventBridge, and CloudWatch. This approach provided:\n\n- Cost efficiency for the early-stage startup\n- Automatic scaling as user numbers grew\n- High availability without complex infrastructure management\n- Flexibility to add new integrations quickly\n\n**Report generation**: We implemented content-based report generation using:\n\n- GPT-3 for natural language generation\n- AWS Lambda for processing\n- Materialized views in PostgreSQL for efficient data access\n- Custom templates for consistent reporting formats\n\n**Authentication system**: We implemented Auth0 for the database synchronization process, leveraging OAuth 2.0 protocols to protect user data and limit access from third parties. This ensured a secure connection between Momos and the various third-party platforms.\n\n![Momos collaboration approach showing team structure and communication](assets/momos-collaboration.webp)\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nThe team structure spanned multiple locations, with engineers in Singapore, India, and Vietnam. We established clear communication channels to ensure effective remote collaboration:\n\n- Daily sync-ups via Slack and Google Meet to address immediate issues\n- Task management through Notion to track progress and priorities\n- Weekly change logs to summarize achievements and maintain transparency\n- Regular review sessions to align on product direction and technical decisions\n\nOur development process emphasized:\n\n- Rapid prototyping to test ideas quickly\n- Iterative development based on feedback\n- Regular deployments to get features to users faster\n- Documentation of APIs and integration points for future expansion\n\nThis collaborative approach allowed us to work effectively despite geographical distribution and time zone differences.\n\n## What we achieved\n\nAfter several months of collaboration, Momos successfully launched their platform and began onboarding their first users. The MVP provided a solid foundation for their business, demonstrating the value of a centralized management solution for F\u0026B merchants.\n\nThe platform we built enabled F\u0026B businesses to:\n\n- **Manage multiple delivery platforms**: Control offerings across Grab, Foodpanda, and Deliveroo from a single dashboard\n- **Track online reputation**: Monitor and respond to customer reviews across various platforms\n- **Deploy targeted advertising**: Create and manage social media ads without specialized marketing knowledge\n- **Generate data-driven insights**: Access comprehensive reports about business performance and customer behavior\n- **Make informed decisions**: Use centralized data to optimize menu offerings, pricing, and marketing efforts\n\n![Momos platform results showing integrated delivery platform data](assets/momos-result1.webp)\n\n![Momos dashboard interface showing analytics overview](assets/momos-result2.webp)\n\n![Momos analytics features displaying customer insights](assets/momos-result3.webp)\n\nKey technical achievements included:\n\n- A scalable integration framework that could easily accommodate new service providers\n- Reliable data synchronization across multiple platforms\n- Secure handling of sensitive merchant account information\n- An intuitive user interface that required minimal training\n- Automated reporting that saved merchants hours of manual work\n\nOur partnership with Momos continues as they grow and evolve.

It started as a partnership between Telenor ASA from Norway and 701Search from Singapore. After 12 years in business with nearly 20% of Malaysia's internet traffic, their website was struggling to keep up with growing demand.\n\nWe helped Mudah change their old, slow system into a modern, scalable one. Our team spent a month working directly with their team in Malaysia to speed up the process and make sure everything went smoothly.\n\nThe goal was to create a platform that could not only handle Mudah's current traffic but also support future growth while providing a better experience for their users. By rebuilding their system with modern technologies, we helped position Mudah for continued success in Malaysia's competitive online marketplace landscape.\n\n![Mudah online marketplace homepage showing classified listings](assets/mudah-main.webp)\n\n## The challenge Mudah was facing\n\nAfter more than a decade serving millions of users, Mudah's website was showing its age. Their system had to handle huge amounts of data from both customers and other services, and their old PHP-based system couldn't keep up anymore.\n\nAs online shopping habits changed, Mudah needed to appeal to younger users with a faster, more responsive website. Their outdated interface and increasingly slow system were making it hard to compete effectively.\n\nThe Mudah team knew they needed a complete overhaul of their infrastructure, code, and user interface. As their Product Manager Prateek said, \"Rebuilding an entire system takes a lot of effort. We didn't have time to hire and train new team members. We needed people who could jump in and get the job done right away.\"\n\nThe challenges they faced were complex:\n\n- Their monolithic PHP system was difficult to maintain and scale\n- Page load times were increasing, affecting user satisfaction\n- The mobile experience was inconsistent and outdated\n- Adding new features had become increasingly complicated\n- The system couldn't handle growing traffic volumes efficiently\n\nThese issues were critically important because they directly affected Mudah's core business and their ability to remain competitive in the evolving e-commerce market.\n\n![Mudah facing technical challenges with their legacy platform](assets/mudah-context.webp)\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe approached the upgrade step by step, converting the old PHP system to a more modern architecture using Go. We separated different parts of the system one by one, starting with the login system to build a solid foundation.\n\n### Technical approach\n\n**Frontend Modernization**: For the website itself, we used Next.js with server-side rendering, which made pages load much faster while also helping search engines find the site more easily. This improved both search rankings and the overall user experience. The component-based architecture allowed for:\n\n- Consistent design across the platform\n- Faster development of new features\n- Better performance on both desktop and mobile\n- Improved SEO through server-side rendering\n\n**Backend Transformation**: We rebuilt the backend services using Go with the Gin framework, which provided:\n\n- Significantly improved performance compared to PHP\n- Better resource utilization on servers\n- More maintainable code structure\n- Easier scaling during traffic spikes\n\n**Mobile Enhancement**: For the mobile version, we improved features, cleaned up the code, and enhanced deep linking using Swift 4 with an MVC structure. This made development faster and debugging easier. Key improvements included:\n\n- Streamlined navigation flows\n- More consistent user experience\n- Better performance on older devices\n- Enhanced integration with the core platform\n\n**Microservice Architecture**: We gradually decomposed the monolithic system into independent services that could be developed, deployed, and scaled separately. This architecture:\n\n- Allowed different teams to work in parallel\n- Made it easier to maintain and update specific features\n- Improved system resilience and fault isolation\n- Supported more efficient resource allocation\n\nThroughout the project, we worked closely with the Mudah team using Slack, Jira, and GitLab to communicate and review code easily. This collaborative approach ensured that our technical implementation aligned with Mudah's business goals and user needs.\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nOur approach to collaboration was tailored to ensure rapid progress while maintaining quality:\n\n- Daily standups to address issues quickly\n- Regular knowledge sharing sessions with the Mudah team\n- Joint code reviews to maintain quality standards\n- Transparent progress tracking through Jira\n- On-site work in Malaysia during critical project phases\n\nThis close collaboration was essential for successfully transforming such a core system while keeping the business running smoothly throughout the transition.\n\n## What we achieved\n\nThe upgrade was a great success. Mudah's new platform gained the speed and flexibility it needed to serve more users efficiently. The modernized system helped them reach new customer groups on both desktop and mobile.\n\nThe technical improvements delivered several measurable benefits:\n\n- **Faster page loads**: Average load times decreased by over 40%\n- **Better scaling**: The system could now handle 3x more concurrent users\n- **Improved maintainability**: New features could be developed and deployed more quickly\n- **Enhanced user experience**: More intuitive interface resulted in longer session times\n- **Mobile optimization**: Significantly improved performance on smartphones and tablets\n\n![Mudah's successful results showing platform improvements](assets/mudah-result.webp)\n\nThis project was the beginning of one of our longest and most successful partnerships. We've continued to work with Mudah on various projects, helping them balance their goals of updating technology while growing their business.\n\nAs Prateek Roy, Mudah.my's Product Manager, said: \"Updating our technology platform and increasing revenue are the two main goals for Mudah.my. Handling both challenges at once is difficult. We got great results from the team - they were skilled and professional. That increased our confidence in the Dwarves, and we're excited to keep working with them.\"\n\nThe successful transformation of Mudah's platform demonstrates how effective technical partnership can help established businesses modernize their systems and maintain their competitive edge in rapidly evolving markets.\n","title":"Upgrading Malaysia's largest online marketplace","short_title":"Mudah","description":"We helped Mudah.my switch from an outdated system to a modern, faster one that can handle more users and grow with their business.","tags":["case-study","marketplace","enterprise"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["duy","tieubao","nikki"],"date":"Tue Mar 09 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"consulting/case-study/mudah.md","slugArray":["consulting","case-study","mudah"]},{"content":"\n**Industry**\\\nProductivity Software\n\n**Location**\\\nUnited States / Global\n\n**Business context**\\\nSolo founder needed technical expertise to turn product concept into reality\n\n**Solution**\\\nBuilt a cross-browser task management extension that works seamlessly across websites\n\n**Outcome**\\\nSuccessfully launched on Chrome Web Store with positive user feedback\n\n**Our service**\\\nFull-stack development / Browser extension development\n\n## Technical highlights\n\n- **Backend**: Elixir with Phoenix framework for reliable API services\n- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, ShadowDOM for isolated components\n- **Data handling**: GraphQL for efficient data loading\n- **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Platform for hosting\n- **Browser technologies**: Chrome Extension API, Mozilla WebExtension API\n- **Communication**: WebSockets for real-time updates\n\n## What we did with Naru\n\n[Naru](https://naru.app/) is a browser extension that brings task management right into your web browser. It was created by Matt, a digital designer from the US who was looking for a better way to stay organized while browsing the web.\n\nMost people have to switch between their browser and other apps to manage their tasks. Matt wanted something that would stay with him as he moved between websites, letting him capture ideas and organize his work without breaking his flow.\n\nWe helped turn this idea into reality by building a browser extension that works like a full-featured productivity app. The extension follows users across different websites and remembers their tasks no matter which tab they're using.\n\nThink of Naru as a smart to-do list that's always available in your browser, helping you stay focused and organized without needing to switch between different apps.\n\n![Naru browser extension showing task management interface](assets/naru-main.webp)\n\n## The challenge Naru solved\n\nPeople who work online face several productivity challenges:\n\n- Tasks and ideas get lost when switching between websites\n- Standard to-do apps live outside the browser, breaking workflow\n- Browser bookmarks don't organize information in a useful way\n- It's hard to stay focused when jumping between different tabs\n\nThe biggest technical challenge was making a browser extension behave like a standalone app. Most extensions are simple add-ons that don't work the same way across different tabs or websites.\n\nAs Matt explained to us:\n\n\u003e \"Keeping the open state for the task board across tabs is the highest priority. Naru must boost productivity, not hinder it.\"\n\nWe needed to create something that felt like part of the browser itself, while offering the power of a dedicated task management app.\n\n![Naru's context showing how it fits into users' workflow](assets/naru-context.webp)\n\n## How we built it\n\nBuilding a browser extension that works like a full application is more complex than it might seem. We had to solve several technical challenges while keeping the interface simple and intuitive.\n\n### Technical approach\n\nTo make Naru work seamlessly across different websites, we applied several innovative approaches:\n\n**ShadowDOM for consistent rendering**: We used ShadowDOM technology to create isolated components that maintain their appearance and functionality regardless of the website they appear on. This prevents conflicts with existing page styles and scripts.\n\n**Cross-tab state synchronization**: We developed a system that keeps task information synchronized across all browser tabs, so users see the same tasks no matter where they're browsing.\n\n**Minimalist interface design**: We created a clean, unobtrusive interface that doesn't compete with website content but remains easily accessible when needed.\n\n**Automated release process**: We built a custom release pipeline that streamlines updates and ensures consistent quality across browser versions.\n\n**GraphQL data layer**: Instead of traditional REST APIs, we used GraphQL to make data loading more efficient and reduce unnecessary network traffic.\n\n![Naru extension design showing component architecture](assets/naru-extension.webp)\n\nThe extension works by injecting a small interface into every web page the user visits. This interface remains hidden until activated, then smoothly reveals a task management panel that floats above the current website.\n\nWhen users add or update tasks, the changes are instantly synchronized across all open tabs through WebSockets, ensuring a consistent experience throughout the browsing session.\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nWorking with Matt in the US meant dealing with an 11-hour time difference. After trying daily video calls (with Matt staying up until 9 PM and us waking up at 8 AM), we realized we needed a better approach.\n\nWe switched to \"async communication\" - instead of daily calls, we:\n\n- Wrote daily check-in notes to share progress\n- Kept meetings focused and brief (15 minutes) for sprint planning and reviews\n- Created two separate lists: \"Icebox\" for future ideas and \"Client feedback\" for immediate concerns\n- Met twice weekly to review these lists and turn them into clear requirements\n\nThis approach helped us stay on track and reduced unnecessary back-and-forth, making the 11-hour time difference much less of an obstacle.\n\n![Naru workflow diagram showing async communication process](assets/naru-workflow.webp)\n\nOur development process included:\n\n- Weekly pre-release versions for internal testing\n- Bi-weekly stable releases for the Chrome Web Store\n- One-week testing periods before each public release\n- Continuous integration to catch issues early\n- Detailed documentation of features and decisions\n\n## What we achieved\n\nAfter just three months of development, we launched the first stable version of Naru on the Chrome Web Store. This marked our first successful browser extension project.\n\nThe extension received positive feedback from early users who appreciated how it:\n\n- Stayed with them as they browsed different websites\n- Made task management simple and intuitive\n- Improved their focus and productivity\n- Integrated smoothly with their browsing habits\n\n![Naru results showing key metrics and user feedback](assets/naru-result.webp)\n\nThe core features we delivered included:\n\n- Task creation and management that persists across websites\n- Custom lists and categories for organization\n- Keyboard shortcuts for quick access\n- Markdown support for rich text formatting\n- Dark and light themes to match browser preferences\n- Offline capability with background synchronization\n\n![Naru interface showing task management system](assets/naru-ui1.webp)\n\n![Naru interface details showing task organization](assets/naru-ui2.webp)\n\nAfter the initial launch, we continued developing more advanced features:\n\n- Team collaboration tools for shared task lists\n- Workspace management for different projects\n- Activity dashboards to track productivity\n- User analytics for insight into work patterns\n\nThe product continues to evolve through a beta program that brings in new users gradually. Our work with Naru demonstrated that browser extensions can be powerful productivity tools that enhance the browsing experience rather than just adding simple features.\n\nNaru exemplifies our approach to product development: understanding user needs, solving complex technical challenges, and delivering a polished experience that feels natural and intuitive.\n","title":"Naru: A task manager that works right in your browser","short_title":"Naru","description":"We built Naru, a browser extension that helps people stay organized and productive while browsing the web.

They wanted to create a network that makes it simple for stores to accept digital payments across Southeast Asia.\n\nWe put together a team of 8 engineers to help build the technical foundation and create a working product from scratch. We worked closely with their team to develop a system that could connect stores with different payment methods.\n\nOur team was responsible for building the core data system – the foundation of the entire platform. This crucial part allows Open Fabric to handle transactions between customers, stores, and payment providers.\n\nThe product we delivered helped Open Fabric launch on time and start growing in Southeast Asia's competitive payment market.\n\n![Open Fabric payment platform dashboard showing transaction analytics](assets/openfabric-main.webp)\n\n## The challenge Open Fabric faced\n\nOpen Fabric needed to build a platform that could serve multiple audiences at once:\n\n- **Merchants** who want to offer more payment options to their customers\n- **Shoppers** who need secure, convenient payment methods\n- **Payment providers** who want to connect with more businesses\n\nThese requirements created several complex technical challenges:\n\n- **Processing high transaction volumes**: The system needed to handle many simultaneous payments while maintaining performance.\n- **Ensuring data security**: Financial information required strong protection through encryption and secure storage.\n- **Meeting industry regulations**: Payment platforms must follow strict compliance standards like PCI DSS.\n- **Building for scale**: The architecture needed to support growth as more merchants and payment providers joined the platform.\n- **Recruiting specialized talent**: Fintech development requires specific expertise that's difficult to find on short notice.\n\n![Open Fabric business challenges diagram showing market complexity](assets/openfabric-challenges.webp)\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe approached the Open Fabric platform with three key priorities: scalability, security, and speed to market – all critical factors for a payment startup in a competitive landscape.\n\n### Technical approach\n\n**Multi-tenant architecture**: We designed the system so a single platform could securely serve many different businesses. This approach:\n\n- Allows both merchants and payment providers to use the same underlying infrastructure\n- Maintains strict data separation between tenants for security\n- Reduces operational costs compared to deploying separate instances\n- Optimizes resource utilization\n- Enables easier scaling as the business grows\n\n**Microservices organization**: Even at this early stage, we structured the system into discrete services to improve maintainability and future development:\n\n1. **Data service**: The central system that manages core information used by other components\n2. **Transaction service**: Handles payment processing between customers and merchants\n3. **Logging service**: Maintains comprehensive audit trails across the platform\n4. **Card service**: A highly isolated service that handles sensitive payment card information\n\n![Open Fabric system architecture diagram showing service relationships](assets/openfabric-architecture.webp)\n\n**Cloud-native implementation**: We built the entire platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS):\n\n- **Serverless computing**: Most services run on AWS Lambda, which automatically scales based on demand\n- **Containerization**: Docker containers provide isolation between different system components\n- **Content delivery**: AWS S3 and CloudFront host static assets like dashboards and documentation\n- **Regional optimization**: We deployed in Singapore to minimize latency for Southeast Asian users\n\n![Open Fabric cloud infrastructure diagram showing AWS components](assets/openfabric-cloud.webp)\n\n**Development environment separation**: We created four distinct environments to support the development lifecycle:\n\n- **Local development**: Individual developer environments for initial coding and testing\n- **Continuous integration**: Automated testing of all code changes\n- **Staging**: A production-like environment for final validation before release\n- **Production**: The secure, monitored environment that serves actual customers\n\n![Open Fabric deployment process workflow showing release stages](assets/openfabric-deployment.webp)\n\nOur development process incorporated several best practices for distributed teams:\n\n- **Trunk-based development**: Single main branch with short-lived feature branches\n- **Coordinated releases**: Synchronized deployments across interdependent services\n- **Design reviews**: Team discussions about architecture and implementations before coding\n- **Automated deployments**: CI/CD pipeline for consistent and reliable releases\n- **Incident management**: Clear procedures for handling production issues\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nOur 8-person engineering team became an extension of Open Fabric's own technical staff. We quickly assembled a team of specialists:\n\n- Senior backend engineers with experience in high-performance financial systems\n- Frontend developers who understood both UI design and backend integration\n- DevOps specialists who could automate testing and deployment processes\n\nWe established clear communication channels for different types of interactions:\n\n- Regular planning sessions for roadmap and feature prioritization\n- Daily standups for progress updates and blocker resolution\n- Technical design reviews for architecture decisions\n- Code reviews for maintaining quality standards\n- Joint on-call rotations for production support\n\nThis approach created a seamless working relationship regardless of physical location, allowing both teams to collaborate effectively whether in office or remote.\n\n## What we achieved\n\nWorking with Open Fabric, we successfully delivered the core components of their payment platform:\n\n- A robust central system that manages the entire payment ecosystem\n- Web interfaces for merchants, payment providers, and administrators\n- A secure multi-tenant architecture that supports different business types\n- A complete working product that enabled market entry\n\nOur partnership provided Open Fabric with several significant advantages:\n\n- **Faster time to market** without compromising on quality or security\n- **Achievement of business milestones** necessary for establishing their position in Southeast Asia\n- **Technical team extension** without the overhead of extensive recruitment\n- **Focus on product strategy** rather than infrastructure concerns\n\nBy providing experienced engineers who integrated seamlessly with their team, we helped Open Fabric invest more in product development while leveraging our technical expertise. Our team didn't just write code – we contributed to architectural decisions and process improvements that will support Open Fabric's growth for years to come.\n\nThe platform we built continues to evolve as Open Fabric expands to new markets and adds more payment options, built on the solid foundation established through our collaboration.\n","title":"Building a payment platform from scratch","short_title":"Open Fabric","description":"We helped Open Fabric build a payment platform that makes it easier for stores to accept digital payments across Southeast Asia.

With 22 years of experience as the UK's largest CRM provider for real estate agencies, they were ready for a major transformation. After being acquired by Accel KKR in 2017, they accelerated their plans to modernize their technology.\n\nTheir goal was ambitious: migrate their desktop applications to the cloud and develop a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that would better serve their small and medium business customers.\n\nWe joined as their offshore development team in Vietnam, taking on prototype development and \"skunkworks\" projects - innovative work that needed to be delivered quickly with minimal management overhead. Our ability to ship quality code on tight timelines made us the perfect partner for their transformation.\n\n![Reapit platform interface showing the cloud-based real estate CRM](assets/reapit-platform.webp)\n\n## The challenge Reapit was solving\n\nReapit already had a strong engineering team of 60 people in the UK, but they needed additional talent to accelerate their growth. Building an internal team would have required headhunters, service fees, and significant onboarding time.\n\nThey were planning a major launch event for their new \"Reapit Foundation\" platform and needed help developing key modules for their small and medium business solutions. This would allow them to test new ideas before the big reveal.\n\nOur team provided Reapit with skilled engineers right when they needed them. They were thrilled to form an Asia offshore team that could help them scale quickly.\n\nBeyond just writing code, we helped Reapit qualify their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and offered advice on long-term technical strategy.\n\n![Reapit's cloud transformation roadmap and goals](assets/reapit-transformation.webp)\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe assembled a specialized cloud development team with senior React.js expertise. Our team focused on two key parts of Reapit's AgencyCloud platform:\n\n### Technical approach\n\n**Reapit Foundation Platform**: We helped develop their cloud-based Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and app marketplace, which allows third-party developers to create apps that integrate with Reapit's core services. This opened up new revenue streams and created additional value for their clients.\n\n**Reapit Geo Diary**: We built a mobile app that lets real estate agents access and manage their appointments while on the go. This improved agent productivity and customer service by providing instant access to critical information from anywhere.\n\nReapit Foundation included three main applications: Admin Portal, Developer Portal, and App Marketplace (which contained Geo Diary and AML Checklist). Having multiple separate apps made the codebase difficult to manage, so we proactively suggested a monorepo approach to unify their solutions.\n\n![Reapit Foundation architecture diagram showing system components](assets/reapit-foundation.webp)\n\nThe monorepo structure provided several benefits:\n\n- Reduced code duplication across projects\n- Simplified dependency management\n- Made it easier to maintain consistent code quality\n- Allowed for shared components and utilities\n- Streamlined the development workflow\n\n![Reapit's app ecosystem showing interconnected applications](assets/reapit-apps.webp)\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nOur account manager worked directly with Reapit's Engineering Team Leader to ensure smooth development progress. We established efficient team practices:\n\n- **Sprint Planning**: Discussing milestones and weekly focus areas\n- **Daily Meetings**: 4PM check-ins to sync work status and resolve problems\n- **Bi-weekly Sprint Updates**: Reviewing completed work and clarifying new tickets\n- **Task Selection**: Team members could choose tasks based on their capacity\n\nThis approach fostered proactivity among team members. We were able to communicate effectively, discuss roadblocks, respond quickly to incidents, and perform at our best.\n\n![Reapit team collaboration session showing remote work](assets/reapit-collaboration.webp)\n\nOur development workflow included:\n\n- Continuous integration to catch issues early\n- Automated testing to ensure quality\n- Regular code reviews to maintain standards\n- Deployment pipelines for efficient releases\n\n![Reapit development workflow diagram showing iterative process](assets/reapit-workflow.webp)\n\n## What we achieved\n\nWith just two weeks for product research and two weeks for development, we delivered a working prototype that enabled Reapit to meet their launch deadline for the Reapit Foundation Launch Event.\n\nReapit quickly followed up with a beta version of their App Store, three mini-apps, and the Foundation Developer Portal - successfully enhancing their Foundation App Marketplace.\n\nOur key technical accomplishments included:\n\n- **Unified architecture**: Migrating separate apps to a monorepo structure that improved maintainability\n- **Component system**: Building with React and Redux for component reusability across applications\n- **Mobile support**: Creating Geo Diary with RPS software integration for field agents\n- **Continuous delivery**: Implementing an integration pipeline for hourly deployments\n- **System integration**: Achieving tight backend/frontend coupling for system robustness\n- **Quality assurance**: Reaching 90% test coverage with end-to-end tests\n- **Developer community**: Launching an open-source repository for bug reports and feature requests\n\n![Reapit marketplace showing available real estate applications](assets/reapit-marketplace.webp)\n\n![Reapit developer portal interface for third-party developers](assets/reapit-developer-portal.webp)\n\n![Reapit mobile application for real estate agents on the go](assets/reapit-mobile-app.webp)\n\nThese innovations helped Reapit transform their business and offer more value to their real estate customers across the UK. By creating a cloud platform with an open marketplace, they've positioned themselves for continued growth in an increasingly digital real estate industry.\n\nDwarves Foundation is a team of design and development experts working closely with clients to craft software, build tech teams, and invest in people who create world's next favorite things.\n","title":"Building cloud solutions for UK real estate","short_title":"Reapit","description":"We joined Reapit as their offshore development team, helping them transform their desktop software into a modern cloud platform.

The app lets drivers pay for fuel directly from their mobile phones, making the refueling process faster and simpler.\n\nThe company wanted to grow beyond basic fuel payments and create a \"super-app\" that would serve drivers with additional on-the-go features and platform integrations. Our team of seven developers joined Setel's engineering team to focus on user conversion - bringing new customers to the platform through deals, vouchers, and marketing campaigns.\n\nWe specifically helped build the Setel website, gift campaigns, and marketing tracking systems that formed the top of their user acquisition funnel.\n\n![Setel mobile app interface showing fuel payment features](assets/setel-main.webp)\n\n## The challenge Setel faced\n\nSetel had one clear goal: make refueling simple and friction-free. To achieve this, they needed to serve three main customer groups:\n\n1. **Drivers** - People who need a smooth, convenient refueling experience in their daily lives\n2. **Businesses** - Companies looking to engage with customers while automating payment processes\n3. **Developers** - Technical partners who need to integrate with Setel's systems\n\nThe challenge was creating features that would attract new users while maintaining the simplicity that made their core fuel payment app popular. They needed to build conversion paths that would bring potential customers into their ecosystem without complicating the user experience.\n\n![Setel's context diagram showing their target customer segments](assets/setel-context.webp)\n\n## How we built it\n\n### Technical approach\n\nWe implemented a microservices architecture that allowed different parts of the system to evolve independently. This approach gave Setel the flexibility to add new features without disrupting their core payment services.\n\nOur team focused on building:\n\n- The public-facing Setel website that serves as the entry point for new users\n- Gift and voucher campaigns to incentivize sign-ups\n- Marketing tracking systems to measure campaign effectiveness\n\nWe used React for frontend development, creating responsive interfaces that worked well on both mobile and desktop. For the backend, we built APIs using TypeScript with the Nest.js framework, which provided a structured approach to development.\n\n### Development process\n\nWe adopted the SWARM process - a collaborative approach where the team works together on a small number of stories at a time. This method helped us:\n\n- Share knowledge across the team\n- Solve problems quickly\n- Avoid distractions and stay focused\n- Build consistent features\n\nFor testing, we implemented a multi-stage approach starting with manual testing, then regression testing, and finally automation. We managed all testing through Zephyr and generated reports with Allure to maintain high quality standards.\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nWe worked as part of Setel's Conversion team, fully focused on supporting their user acquisition funnel. Since Setel is an established business with defined protocols, we formed a team that could work independently while adopting their practices.\n\nCommunication happened remotely through several channels:\n\n- Daily discussions in Slack\n- Sprint tracking in Jira\n- Technical documentation in Confluence\n\nThis structured approach ensured our team integrated smoothly with Setel's existing operations while still maintaining the agility to deliver features quickly.\n\n## What we achieved\n\nThrough our partnership with Setel, we successfully delivered several key features that expanded their platform capabilities. The most significant was The Food Bank Programme - a community support initiative by Petronas Station Business Partners that provides essential items at selected Petronas stations nationwide.\n\nThis programme exemplified how Setel was growing beyond just fuel payments to become a platform that connects the local community with valuable services. It demonstrated Setel's commitment to social responsibility while also creating new touchpoints for user engagement.\n\n![Setel's Food Bank Programme interface showing community support initiative](assets/setel-result.webp)\n\nOur work helped Setel enhance their user conversion funnel, bringing more Malaysians into their digital payment ecosystem. By creating compelling offers and a smooth onboarding experience, we supported Setel's growth as Malaysia's premier fuel payment platform.\n\nThe features we built fit seamlessly into Setel's larger vision of creating a comprehensive super-app that makes daily tasks easier for Malaysian drivers. Our focus on the conversion aspects complemented their core functionality, helping transform Setel from a simple payment tool into a multi-faceted platform that serves users in various aspects of their lives.\n","title":"Building Setel's fuel payment super-app for Malaysian drivers","short_title":"Setel","description":"We helped Setel expand their fuel payment app into a full-featured platform that makes refueling simple for Malaysian drivers.

We created an end-to-end solution for common problems travelers face: getting lost, confusion about plans, communication issues, and the biggest headache of all – managing shared expenses.\n\nOur design team took ownership of the entire process, from initial user research through visual design to creating a fully interactive prototype. The result is an intuitive app built specifically for young, tech-savvy travelers who love backpacking with friends.\n\nSol allows users to connect through social networks (starting with Facebook), track each other on a map, and send alerts if they run into trouble while exploring. The thoughtfully designed interface makes group coordination simple, even in unfamiliar places.\n\n## The challenge Sol addressed\n\nGroup travel should be fun, but the logistics can quickly become stressful. Through user interviews with young travelers, we identified several key pain points:\n\n- **Getting separated** from friends in unfamiliar locations\n- **Losing track of plans** when schedules change on the fly\n- **Communication difficulties** when traveling internationally\n- **Expense management** becoming a source of tension between friends\n\nThese challenges often detract from the travel experience and can strain friendships. Existing solutions typically addressed only one aspect of the problem – location sharing OR expense tracking OR planning – but not all of them together in an intuitive way.\n\nOur challenge was to create a single, cohesive app that would solve all these problems while being enjoyable to use. The solution needed to work well for groups of varying sizes and accommodate the spontaneous nature of travel.\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe approached the design of Sol with careful attention to both functionality and aesthetics, knowing that our target users value both.\n\n### Research and target audience\n\nWe started by talking directly with young travelers, asking questions about their habits, frustrations, and needs. Through these conversations, we learned that people love exploring new places but struggle with group coordination, expense tracking, and staying connected.\n\nThese insights became the foundation for Sol's feature set and design approach. We focused on creating an experience for users who are:\n\n- Tech-savvy and comfortable with mobile apps\n- Social and travel frequently with friends\n- Value both independence and group coordination\n- Concerned about budgeting and fair expense sharing\n\n### Visual design system\n\n![Sol color palette](assets/sol-colors.webp)\n\nWe crafted a visual identity that resonates with young travelers:\n\n- **Color scheme**: We chose Cerise (a vibrant dark pink with red undertones) as our primary color to convey energy, excitement, and youth. For readability in various lighting conditions, we used dark blue text (Midnight Express) on white backgrounds.\n\n- **Logo design**: Our logo combines two key elements – the location tracking feature and the app's name \"Sol\" (meaning sun). We used negative space and gradients to create a modern, minimal style that represents both location pins and imagery of the sun and mountains.\n\n![Sol logo design](assets/sol-logo.webp)\n\n- **Typography**: We used San Francisco Pro Display, the default iOS font, to ensure clarity and familiarity for users while keeping the app feeling natural and easy to read.\n\n![Sol typography](assets/sol-typography.webp)\n\n- **Icons and components**: We designed simple, intuitive icons that provide clear visual cues for navigation. The bottom sheet component gives users quick access to group information, member lists, locations, and expenses while maintaining context of the map.\n\n![Sol icons](assets/sol-icons.webp)\n\n![Sol key components](assets/sol-components.webp)\n\n![Sol user cards](assets/sol-user-card.webp)\n\n![Sol map view](assets/sol-map-view.webp)\n\n### Interaction design and animations\n\nSince Sol targets young users, we made the app engaging through thoughtful animations that serve both functional and aesthetic purposes:\n\n- **Onboarding flow**: For first-time users, we created a smooth onboarding experience with natural page animations and a consistent bottom button for easy progression.\n\n![Sol onboarding experience](assets/sol-onboarding.webp)\n\n- **App walkthrough**: We included a quick tour of different sections to help users find their way around.\n\n![Sol app walkthrough](assets/sol-walkthrough.webp)\n\n- **Information switching**: Group details are divided into four sections (Members, Journey, Expenses, and Summary) with animations that mimic flipping through notes.\n\n![Sol information switching](assets/sol-switching.webp)\n\n- **Location management**: When users reorder their location list, we highlight the selected location with a subtle shadow for clarity.\n\n![Sol location reordering](assets/sol-locations.webp)\n\n- **Member tracking**: The map features animations showing routes and movement between locations, helping users understand how to reach their friends.\n\n![Sol member tracking](assets/sol-tracking.webp)\n\n- **Device management**: Swipe gestures with smooth transitions make it easy to manage connected devices.\n\n![Sol device management](assets/sol-devices.webp)\n\n### Interactive prototyping\n\nWe built a high-fidelity interactive prototype using ProtoPie, which offered the best balance of powerful features without requiring coding knowledge. This allowed us to create complex mobile interactions and animations that users would expect.\n\nFor key features like segment switching and map routes, we created sophisticated animations:\n\n- **Segment switching**: We built a system where tapping an icon (Members, Journey, Expenses, or Summary) triggers a natural sliding animation to that section.\n\n![Sol segment switching animation](assets/sol-segment.webp)\n\n- **Map route animation**: To show how people move from one point to another, we created growing path animations that simulate movement along routes.\n\n![Sol route animations](assets/sol-routes.webp)\n\n## What we achieved\n\nThrough our comprehensive design process for Sol, we created:\n\n1. **A complete design system** with a cohesive visual language, including colors, typography, icons, and components\n2. **An intuitive user experience** that addresses real problems faced by travelers\n3. **Engaging interactions** that make the app enjoyable to use while serving practical purposes\n4. **A fully functional prototype** that demonstrates the app's capabilities and validates the concept\n\nThe final product helps friends stay connected and organized during their adventures together. It solves key problems that typically cause friction during group travel, from coordinating meetups to splitting expenses fairly.\n\nSol exemplifies our approach to product design: deeply understanding user needs, creating thoughtful solutions, and delivering a polished experience that's both functional and delightful to use.\n","title":"Sol: Making group travel easier and more fun","short_title":"Sol","description":"We designed Sol, a travel app that helps groups stay connected, organized, and on budget during trips.

In a rapidly growing startup scene, founders needed a central place to connect with each other, share experiences, and find resources to help their businesses succeed.\n\nWe collaborated with StartupVN to build this online community from the ground up. Our goal was to create a user-friendly platform that would make it easy for entrepreneurs to network, access mentorship, and discover funding opportunities - all in one place.\n\n![StartupVN community platform](assets/startupvn-main.webp)\n\nThe platform offers several key features:\n\n- A community forum where founders can ask questions and share insights\n- Events listings for networking and learning opportunities\n- Resource libraries with guides and tools for startups\n- Profiles for startups and founders to showcase their work\n- Mentorship connections to link experienced business leaders with new entrepreneurs\n\n## The challenge StartupVN was facing\n\nVietnam's startup ecosystem has seen incredible growth in recent years, but entrepreneurs faced several challenges:\n\n![StartupVN business context](assets/startupvn-context.webp)\n\n1. **Scattered Information**: Valuable resources, events, and opportunities were spread across many different websites and platforms, making them hard to find\n2. **Limited Networking**: Many founders, especially those outside major cities, had few chances to connect with other entrepreneurs and investors\n3. **Knowledge Gaps**: New founders often lacked access to the practical knowledge and mentorship needed to grow their businesses\n\nStartupVN wanted to address these problems with a single, easy-to-use platform. They needed a technical partner who could not only build the solution but also understand the unique needs of the Vietnamese startup community.\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe approached this project with a focus on creating a platform that would be both powerful and simple to use. The system needed to handle community discussions, user profiles, event management, and resource libraries while remaining fast and responsive.\n\n### Technical approach\n\nOur technical approach included:\n\n- **Modern API development**: We used Node.js with Express to create a flexible and scalable API that could handle various types of content and user interactions.\n- **Fast frontend experience**: We built the user interface with React.js and Next.js to provide a smooth, responsive experience that works well even on slower internet connections.\n- **Flexible data storage**: MongoDB offered the flexibility we needed to store diverse content types, from forum posts to event listings to user profiles.\n- **Powerful search capabilities**: We implemented Elasticsearch to help users quickly find relevant information across the entire platform.\n- **Scalable infrastructure**: We deployed on Google Cloud Platform to ensure reliable performance that could grow as the user base expanded.\n- **Microservices architecture**: We built the community features using microservices, allowing different parts of the platform to be updated independently without disrupting the entire system.\n- **Realtime engagement**: We implemented notifications to keep users informed about community activities and relevant opportunities.\n- **Smart recommendations**: We created a system that connects users with content and opportunities most relevant to their interests and needs.\n\n### Security and accessibility\n\nSecurity was essential for this platform, so we implemented robust user authentication, permission systems, and data protection measures. We also made sure the platform worked well on mobile devices, as many Vietnamese entrepreneurs primarily use smartphones to access online resources.\n\n### Collaborative development\n\nThroughout development, we worked closely with the StartupVN team, gathering feedback from actual entrepreneurs to refine the platform's features and user experience. This collaborative approach ensured we were building something that truly met the needs of the Vietnamese startup community.\n\n## What we achieved\n\nThe StartupVN platform launched successfully and quickly became a valuable resource for Vietnamese entrepreneurs:\n\n![StartupVN platform features](assets/startupvn-feature.webp)\n\n- **Growing Community**: Thousands of entrepreneurs joined the platform in the first few months\n- **Active Engagement**: Users regularly participate in discussions, sharing knowledge and supporting each other\n- **Resource Access**: The platform has made valuable startup resources more accessible, especially for founders outside major cities\n- **Successful Connections**: Several startups reported finding mentors, partners, and even investors through the platform\n\nStartupVN has continued to evolve, with new features being added based on community feedback.

In our most recent collaboration, we helped them implement a micro frontend architecture with a shared design system that all their applications could use.\n\nMicro frontend is an architectural approach that breaks down a large website into smaller, independent pieces. Different teams can work on different pieces without stepping on each other's toes, and everything comes together seamlessly for the end user.\n\nFor Swift, this approach solved several critical challenges they were facing with their growing e-commerce platform. We focused particularly on building a shared design system that would create consistency across all their applications while making development more efficient.\n\n*Note: \"Swift\" isn't the company's real name - we've changed it to respect their privacy. But everything shared here comes from real interviews and experiences.*\n\n## The challenge Swift faced\n\nAs Swift's e-commerce platform grew, their development process became increasingly complex and difficult to manage. Large projects were becoming unwieldy, with multiple teams trying to work on the same codebase simultaneously.\n\nThey faced several key challenges:\n\n- **Development bottlenecks**: Teams were waiting on each other to complete work before they could proceed\n- **Inconsistent user experience**: Different parts of the platform had different looks and behaviors\n- **Duplicate code**: Teams were recreating the same UI components multiple times\n- **Slow release cycles**: The monolithic structure meant even small changes required extensive testing\n\nThey needed a way to make their development more efficient while ensuring a consistent user experience across all their applications.\n\n## How we built it\n\nAfter analyzing Swift's needs, we helped them implement a micro frontend architecture with a shared design system at its core.\n\n### Technical approach\n\nWe divided the platform into smaller, more manageable chunks based on page and business purpose. This resulted in at least ten separate applications, each with a dedicated team:\n\n- Login screens\n- User profiles\n- Ad management tools\n- Messaging system\n- Design system components\n- And several others\n\nFor the shared design system, we implemented a comprehensive solution using:\n\n- **React components**: We built reusable UI elements that could be shared across all applications, ensuring consistency while allowing for customization where needed.\n- **Storybook documentation**: We created extensive documentation and interactive examples using Storybook, making it easy for all teams to understand how to use each component.\n- **Component-scoped styling**: We bundled CSS with each component using CSS-in-JS techniques, preventing style conflicts when components are used in different applications.\n- **npm package distribution**: We packaged the design system as an npm package with proper versioning, making it easy for teams to install and update.\n- **Testing framework**: We established thorough testing procedures to ensure components worked correctly in all environments and use cases.\n\n### Implementation strategy\n\nThe biggest technical challenge was creating components flexible enough to work across all the different applications. We implemented a rigorous development process that included:\n\n1. Identifying common UI patterns across applications\n2. Building components with the right balance of flexibility and consistency\n3. Thoroughly testing components in multiple environments\n4. Creating clear documentation so all teams could easily understand how to use them\n\n### Team workflow\n\nThe process we established is straightforward:\n\n1. The design system team builds and thoroughly tests components\n2. The package is published to npm with proper versioning\n3. Other teams install the package and import just the components they need\n4. Teams provide feedback to continuously improve the system\n\nWe recommended building UI independently in each app first, then identifying shared components to add to the design system only after everything was stable. This approach reduces risk when upgrading because components have already been thoroughly tested.\n\n## What we achieved\n\nThe micro frontend architecture and shared design system have genuinely improved Swift's development process. The first version has been successfully released and implemented in production applications.\n\nKey benefits include:\n\n- **Faster development cycles**: Teams can now work independently without blocking each other, leading to more rapid feature releases.\n- **Consistent user experience**: All applications share the same UI components, creating a unified experience for users across the platform.\n- **Reduced code duplication**: Common components are built once and shared, eliminating redundant work and improving code quality.\n- **Easier maintenance**: Updates to the design system automatically improve all applications, making it simpler to implement platform-wide changes.\n- **Better scalability**: New teams and applications can be added without disrupting existing work, allowing the platform to grow more efficiently.\n\nWe've already successfully integrated the shared design system into Swift's Ads Management Dashboard, with plans to expand to other applications soon.\n\nThe Swift team considers this implementation a success and plans to continue using this approach for future development. The architecture we helped them build is well-suited to their specific business needs and will support their growth for years to come.\n\nThis project is just one example of how we're helping partners implement micro frontend architecture. As we work with more companies on similar challenges, we'll continue sharing insights and best practices.\n","title":"Swift: Building a micro frontend design system for e-commerce","short_title":"Swift","description":"We helped Swift, an e-commerce partner, implement a micro frontend architecture with a shared design system that improved development efficiency and created a consistent user experience across multiple applications.","tags":["ecommerce","case-study"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["mashiro5951"],"date":"Mon Apr 03 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"consulting/case-study/swift.md","slugArray":["consulting","case-study","swift"]},{"content":"\n**Industry**\\\nCryptocurrency\n\n**Location**\\\nIndonesia / Global\n\n**Business context**\\\nCrypto startup needed to expand their platform to reach more customers\n\n**Solution**\\\nDeveloped a redesigned web platform and Android app with modern UI and trading features\n\n**Outcome**\\\nSuccessfully launched on schedule, allowing Tokenomy to grow their user base and add new features\n\n**Our service**\\\nFrontend development / Mobile app development\n\n## Technical highlights\n\n- **Backend**: Elixir, Phoenix for reliable API services\n- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, Redux for responsive web interfaces\n- **Mobile**: Kotlin, Reactivex for Android development\n- **Architecture**: MVVM pattern for the Android app\n- **Database**: PostgreSQL, RESTful API\n- **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Platform\n\n## What we did with Tokenomy\n\nTokenomy is a cryptocurrency investment platform that started in 2017 as an innovation arm of INDODAX, one of Indonesia's largest crypto exchanges.

They came to us with a challenge: build a new data system that would make cloud deployment simple for their clients. Together, we created Voconic - a cloud platform that lets users deploy complex solutions with just a few clicks.\n\nOur team started with three engineers during early development and grew to six as the project expanded. We built Voconic as a complete package in partnership with Google, focusing on making cloud operations simpler for financial sector clients.\n\nThe platform we created allows CJC's clients to deploy and manage cloud solutions without dealing with the technical complexities typically involved. It works across different cloud providers and environments, making the entire process seamless.\n\n![Voconic cloud platform dashboard showing deployment options](assets/voconic-main.webp)\n\n\u003e \"We were looking for a team that we could entrust our new Voconic cloud platform to. We found Dwarves among others, well known for industry experience in Go development, cloud platforms, and Kubernetes.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e *- Paul Kossowski, Manager at CJC*\n\n## The challenge CJC faced\n\nFinancial companies deal with massive amounts of sensitive data that needs reliable, secure processing. Setting up cloud systems for this data traditionally required specialized knowledge and significant manual effort, which was time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nCJC wanted to create a solution that would give their clients more flexibility and control while reducing the technical burden. They identified several key needs:\n\n- Moving away from expensive, inflexible data systems\n- Easily switching between different data sources and technologies\n- Maintaining continuous delivery of real-time data\n- Simplifying the complexity of cloud deployments\n\nThe financial sector has strict requirements for security and reliability, which added another layer of complexity to the challenge.\n\n![Cloud deployment challenges showing complex manual processes](assets/voconic-context.webp)\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe approached this project by focusing on automation and user experience to hide the underlying complexity of cloud operations.\n\n### Technical approach\n\nWe built Voconic using industry-standard technologies - Docker containers and Kubernetes - to ensure reliability and compatibility. Our solution included several key components:\n\n**Complete development from scratch**: We created the backend, frontend, and command-line tools specifically designed for cloud deployment.\n\n**Golang-powered backend**: We chose Golang for its performance and built deep integrations with Google Cloud Platform that enable one-click deployment.\n\n**Multi-cloud support**: The platform works seamlessly with both Google Cloud and AWS, giving users flexibility in their cloud strategy.\n\n**Intelligent automation**: The system can automatically diagnose and fix issues when containers crash, reducing the need for manual intervention.\n\n**Optimized file handling**: We built a separate service for file uploads that splits large files into smaller chunks with cached data, making the upload process more reliable.\n\n**Command-line interface**: For power users and automation scenarios, we created a CLI that supports complex operations and repetitive tasks.\n\n![Cloud deployment solution architecture showing automated components](assets/voconic-deployment.webp)\n\nThe platform includes monitoring and alerting systems that keep track of deployed applications and notify users about potential issues before they become problems.\n\n![Platform architecture diagram showing system components](assets/voconic-built.webp)\n\n### How we collaborated\n\nWorking with CJC's team required clear communication across different time zones. We established a workflow that kept everyone aligned:\n\n- Google Chat for daily discussions and quick questions\n- Google Hangout for team meetings and progress updates\n- Asana for task tracking and project management\n\nThis approach allowed us to work efficiently with CJC's team while maintaining transparency throughout the development process.\n\n![Cloud journey diagram showing implementation phases](assets/voconic-journey.webp)\n\n## What we achieved\n\nAfter months of dedicated work, we successfully delivered a working MVP of the Voconic platform with significant benefits for CJC and their clients:\n\n**User-friendly interface**: We created a web interface that makes complex cloud operations accessible to non-technical users.\n\n**Custom deployment definitions**: We developed a YAML format that defines how to create a product, with CLI support for advanced users.\n\n**Reliable testing**: We implemented comprehensive automation testing to ensure the platform works consistently.\n\n**Pre-release validation**: The platform provides an internal working version before releasing to cloud providers, adding an extra layer of error prevention.\n\nThe completed Voconic platform has significantly reduced the time and complexity involved in cloud deployments for financial companies. Instead of spending hours or days setting up cloud infrastructure, CJC's clients can now deploy what they need in minutes with fewer errors and less specialized knowledge required.\n\nThis allows financial companies to focus on their core business rather than getting caught up in technical details, while still taking advantage of modern cloud capabilities.\n","title":"Building Voconic's cloud platform with Google for financial services","short_title":"Voconic","description":"We helped CJC create Voconic, a cloud platform that makes it easy for financial companies to deploy complex systems with just a few clicks, reducing manual effort and errors while working across different cloud providers.","tags":["case-study","partnership"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["tieubao","nikki","duy"],"date":"Sat Oct 24 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"consulting/case-study/voconic.md","slugArray":["consulting","case-study","voconic"]}],"isListPage":true},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...slug]","query":{"slug":["consulting","case-study"]},"buildId":"nt92wOo8rm86ZfKBZpen8","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
