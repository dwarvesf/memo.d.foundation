Players can own and trade in-game items as NFTs. Compared to their earlier attempts at blockchain gaming, this release seems to have a more subdued rollout. It’s interesting to see how they’re still experimenting in this space, despite mixed reactions to NFTs in gaming.\n\n### [Outdated Cancer Guidelines Are a Problem](https://seangeiger.substack.com/p/why-are-cancer-guidelines-stuck-in)\n\nCancer treatment guidelines are lagging behind modern research, and it’s a problem. Outdated recommendations can slow down access to better care, which is frustrating when new discoveries are being made all the time. The reasons range from bureaucratic inertia to a lack of streamlined systems for updating standards. It raises a bigger question about whether tech like AI or better data processing can help bridge this gap and bring treatments up to speed faster.\n\n[**AI vs. Humans: A Tough Question**](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/23/ai_job_replacement_comment/)\n\nHere’s a thought-provoking question from The Register: are you a better value than AI? As AI becomes more efficient at certain tasks, companies are reevaluating the balance between human employees and automated systems. While humans bring creativity and adaptability to the table, it’s clear that the bar for what we offer compared to machines is shifting. It’s worth considering where we stand as AI continues to evolve.\n\n[**ChatGPT Took a Break**](https://www.notion.so/169657c9646d8016a308c8ad928b4ef1?pvs=21)\n\nIf you noticed ChatGPT acting up this week, you weren’t alone. OpenAI’s chatbot had an outage, with users reporting server errors. The issue was tied to an upstream provider and was resolved fairly quickly. Just a little hiccup to remind us that even our favorite tools have their off days.\n\n### [Product Highlight: Hyperliquid](https://hyperfoundation.org/)\n\nThis week’s standout is Hyperliquid, a decentralized perpetual exchange (DEX) designed to combine the efficiency of centralized exchanges with the transparency of decentralized finance. Built on its proprietary Layer 1 blockchain, Hyperliquid offers high-speed, gas-free transactions and a fully on-chain order book, enabling precise trades and reduced slippage.\n\nHere’s where Hyperliquid stands in numbers:\n\n- Total Value Locked (TVL): $2.168 billion\n- Market Cap: $9.002 billion\n- Token Price: $26.83\n- Fully Diluted Valuation: $26.957 billion\n- 24h Token Volume: $320.92 million\n- Volume (24h): $312.49 million\n- Perpetuals Volume (24h): $3.85 billion\n- Fees (annualized): $62.9 million\n- Revenue (annualized): $62.9 million\n\nHyperliquid just flipped Solana in 24-hour fees generated.

But AI wasn’t just in PCs — smart glasses with advanced features, health-tracking smart rings, and AI-powered home gadgets were everywhere. This year’s event made it clear that AI is no longer just a futuristic concept but something becoming part of everyday life.\n\nThe AI boom didn’t stop at tech expos; it’s also driving [Wall Street’s latest bull run](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/ai-boom-fed-rate-cuts-lift-us-stocks-new-highs-2024-2024-12-31/). As 2024 wrapped up, the S\u0026P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq hit near-record highs, with tech stocks — especially AI leaders — leading the charge. Nvidia saw its market value soar past $3 trillion with a staggering 170% gain, while Tesla also returned to a $1 trillion valuation. While economic recovery and lower interest rates helped, the unstoppable momentum behind AI seems to be the real driving force behind the market’s performance.\n\n[Networking companies](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ai-networking-nvidia-cisco-broadcom-arista-bce88c76) are also benefiting massively from AI’s rapid growth. Firms like Broadcom, Cisco, Arista Networks, and Marvell Technology have seen their stocks climb as the demand for advanced networking technology skyrockets. With AI models requiring vast amounts of data and computing power, these companies are now essential players in keeping the digital infrastructure running smoothly for AI operations.\n\nMeanwhile, [investment banks](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/investment-banks-look-to-2025-ai-push-to-remove-junior-drudge-work-8dfc606c) are turning to AI to boost efficiency and reduce workloads, particularly for junior bankers. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and UBS have all started using generative AI tools to automate tasks like creating pitch decks and regulatory documentation — work often handed to entry-level analysts. This shift could be a game-changer, helping banks focus on strategic decision-making while easing the workload on overburdened teams.\n\nThe [35% decline in AI job postings in Australia](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=TAWEB_WRE170_a\u0026dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theaustralian.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Ftechnology%2Fai-jobs-ads-are-shrinking-in-australia-new-data-reveals%2Fnews-story%2Fc58c961af4fa5461555a90ae38782ec3\u0026memtype=anonymous\u0026mode=premium\u0026v21=GROUPB-Segment-1-NOSCORE\u0026V21spcbehaviour=append) since the launch of ChatGPT reflects changing market dynamics.

I went to 2 cool events in Vietnam recently and I’ve got some fun thoughts to share. Tired of boring tech talk? I’ll tell you what I saw and what got me excited or curious. No big words, just my real take. Let me know what you think.\n\n# First Stop: XDC Network to the World, Building Asia's Web3 Ecosystem Roadshow\n\nI showed up at this Web3 event hoping for something big. It was pretty quiet though. A few years back Web3 felt wild and free, startups had crazy fun ideas. This time it was more people in suits playing it safe. I thought Web3 was about breaking rules so I wondered: is it changing? Maybe it’s just this event. My friend Terrance said some builders don’t come to these things, they’re out there making stuff on their own. That’s cool to think about. The talks got lively when investors got excited about trading apps the Vietnam government likes. \n\nI talked to one VC from Southeast Asia who said they’d love to put money into government-backed CEXes. They think it’s the future, big groups jumping into crypto. It sounds like an easy win. Some people said governments might push out platforms that don’t follow rules but others think it’s a chance to grow. In November 2024, a [Chainalysis report](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/central-southern-asia-crypto-adoption-2024/) said Vietnam got $100 billion in cryptocurrency inflows. Most of this came through **centralized exchanges** CEXes. Big investors, and retails like using them. Plus, the [VnExpress article from January 2025](https://vnexpress.net/de-xuat-thu-nghiem-san-giao-dich-tien-so-tai-trung-tam-tai-chinh-4837314.html) shows the Ministry of Planning and Investment pushing to test-run crypto trading platforms in places like Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang by 2025\n\nHere’s why Vietnam’s government wants to help these exchanges grow:\n\n- Rules That Work: They can stop the crypto mess from going wild, keeping it safe and legal, and no shady scams allowed.\n- More Jobs, More Money: More exchanges mean more gigs and cash for Vietnam. It’s a win for workers and the economy.\n- New Tech Vibes: It gets people cooking up fresh tech ideas, making Vietnam look smart and cutting-edge.\n- Tax Cash: They can grab some tax money from all those crypto trades. With billions flowing, taxing profits means more bucks for stuff like roads and schools.\n- Big League Status: It puts Vietnam on the global crypto map, pulling in big investors and making the country look legit.\n\n# Next Up: What’s Up HCM, Startup Demo Night\n\nA few days later I hit a startup night in Ho Chi Minh City. Wow what a difference. AI startups showed off some amazing stuff. VCs couldn’t take their eyes off one AI that fixes order mistakes, it’s a big deal for businesses. I think it’s super smart even if it might mean fewer jobs. It’s a win for companies and I can see why they’re excited.\n\n![](assets/event-takeaways-1st-1.webp)\n\nI met Justin from [Costella.](https://www.costella.co/) He said the tech world’s changing, less hiring of newbies and more focus on skilled pros because the market’s shaky. He’s built a cool tool that figures out your emotions from how you talk. He’d love your help testing it, try it out and tell him how it could help you or your business. Then I talked to Eduardo from [Asserto.](https://asserto.ai/) He’s been a developer for over 20 years, through dot-com days, web apps, and mobile apps, and says this AI wave is the wildest yet. He’s making a platform to test prompts and needs testers, plus a sales person and a frontend dev. Give him a hand if you can. \n\nI also met Jeremy from [Nex AI](https://www.nexai.app/), and he’s super cool. His team made a tool that helps businesses by doing data entry for them. It saves money and time, so companies don’t have to deal with boring paperwork. The error rate is super low, and it can scan PDFs and pictures too. Johnathan said they’re testing it in Vietnam with some startups who love how fast it works. Really neat for big or small businesses. They’re in Singapore and looking for more people to try it out here. It’s simple, smart, and cuts the junk work. Worth a look if you want to save cash. \n\nThese innovations reflect a broader AI boom in Vietnam and South East Asia. According to [OpenGov Asia](https://opengovasia.com/2025/02/08/vietnams-ai-future-innovation-policy-and-growth/), 80% of Vietnamese businesses embraced AI last year, topping the regional average of 69%. At QVIC 2024, 70% of solutions featured AI to tackle business challenges. Fueling this surge, NVIDIA’s new AI-focused R\u0026D center in Vietnam is set to drive further innovation and open doors for tech talent.\n\nNot everything was great. Some AI chat tools were for small silly stuff, kind of weak. One guy called his idea “big news” but it felt fake so I tuned out. Still the good ones solve real problems and the crowd was pumped. New people are coming to Vietnam to start things, it’s a vibe I could feel even if I didn’t count them. \n\nThat was my week, and I’m feeling good about it. The Web3 event showed me things are shifting, maybe getting ready for something bigger. The AI night was bursting with fresh ideas, and even with some worries, the energy there was electric. Vietnam’s alive with people chasing dreams and building cool stuff. I think we’re onto something real here, not just noise, and it’s only going to grow. What do you think? Can’t wait to see what’s next. Catch you soon.\n","title":"Talks and Takeaways from the Scene: Part 1","short_title":"1st Talks and Takeaways","description":"Talks and Takeaways from the Scene Part 1","tags":["consulting","market-report","tech-report"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["minh"],"date":"Thu Mar 13 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"consulting/market-report/event-takeaways-1st.md","slugArray":["consulting","market-report","event-takeaways-1st"]},{"content":"\n\n\nI recently went to two Web3 events in Vietnam: Berachain and Babylon. Both were full of energy, with people excited to talk about the future of cryptocurrency. Here’s what I learned, with some cool ideas from Berachain’s community approach mixed in.\n\n### Berachain: Growing in Asia with a Fun Community\n\nAt the Berachain event, everyone was focused on growing in Asia, places like Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Vietnam. Asia has tons of people online, so it’s a great spot for crypto projects to expand. With over 2.93 billion internet users in Asia as of 2024, it’s no wonder projects are flocking here.\n\nBut there were some challenges. People said it’s really hard to find local experts who know how to market Web3 projects. And it’s not just talk, there are only 23,000 Web3 developers globally compared to 26 million in Web2, making talent scarce, especially in Southeast Asia, according to AngelHack. But that’s more like an industry problem:\n\n![](assets/event2-1.webp)\n\nThis has become the consensus and most of the comment section agreed with this take. Some argued that it happened in most industries, while some stated it was simply because talents coudn’t keep up with this space’s rapid change. Another problem is token prices. When prices go up, everyone’s happy, lots of people join and groups get active. But when prices drop, it gets quiet. It’s hard to keep things going strong all the time.\n\nBerachain is doing something different. They’re building a fun community with memes and ideas people connect with, like bears, tho they prefer to be referred as “beras”. They’ve got accounts that post funny stuff, making the project feel friendly and exciting. This could attract talented people who get both tech and local culture.\n\n![](assets/event2-2.webp)\n\nThey also have programs that rewards people for helping out, teaching others, spreading the word, and staying active. They give out things like airdrops and NFT whitelisted spots tied to their bera themes. This keeps their community strong, even when the market isn’t doing well. In Asia, where regular marketing can feel useless, this could work really well.\n\nHowever, Ethereum built its whole vibe on sharing free code with everyone and keeping things super decentralized, no bosses, no central control, just pure tech freedom. But the ETH community sentiment is at all-time lows right now. There’s absolutely no sustainable playbook for growth here.\n\n### Babylon: A New Way to Use Bitcoin\n\nAt the Babylon event, they talked about a new idea: a way to earn extra money (yields) from altcoins while keeping your Bitcoin safe in your wallet. You don’t have to move it anywhere, and they’re even building their own blockchain. People were pumped but also careful, asking things like, “Is my Bitcoin safe?” and “Where do the rewards come from?” With Bitcoin’s market cap exceeding $1.6 trillion now, it’s understandable why people are cautious about new staking ideas.\n\n![](assets/event2-3.webp)\n\nThis could be huge cause most of Bitcoin holders don’t do anything with them, they just HOLD them? I do see a use case gap for the maxis, but there are worries. This protocol give out rewards/yields as alt-coins. The altcoins you earn might lose value fast. Plus, the tech is new, and people want proof it’s secure before they trust it with their Bitcoin. Still, it’s an exciting idea. They’ve just had the airdrop snapshot for the community, which could help it grow. Anyways, event’s rated as 5/10, too much technical jargon was mentioned. The room was full when I came in, nearly half left during the presentation. Guess the majority still don’t care about the technical stuff, they probably just want their portfolio to go up. That’s some tips for the presenters, mention the audience’s bags.\n\n![](assets/event2-4.webp)\n\nOkay, so I hit up these events. It’s definitely got some potentials, but it’s got some real headaches too like where do you find enough brainy folks to make it all work, and how do you deal with the market going wild one day and crashing the next? Berachain’s got this chill vibe going, trying to build a fun, tight-knit crew, and that could totally patch up some of these problems. They’re not just obsessing over token prices like everyone else, they’re betting on people sticking around for the long haul, which might actually make something that doesn’t die out fast. Then there’s Babylon, going in with this idea that could flip the script, even if it’s got some sketchy risks. \n\nAsia’s got the people and the hype to pull off Web3, no doubt, but it needs some clever moves to really take off. Berachain’s whole “let’s make a community people love” thing could be the secret sauce showing it’s not just about getting huge, it’s about creating a spot where folks wanna hang. Honestly, I’m kinda over the quick cash grabs; we should be building vibes and cultures that stick around.","title":"Talks and Takeaways from the Scene: Part 2","short_title":"2nd Talks and Takeaways","description":"Talks and Takeaways from the Scene Part 2","tags":["consulting","market-report","tech-report"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["minh"],"date":"Tue Mar 25 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"consulting/market-report/event-takeaways-2nd.md","slugArray":["consulting","market-report","event-takeaways-2nd"]}],"isListPage":true},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...slug]","query":{"slug":["consulting","market-report"]},"buildId":"Z35PZssMer_dQKU5U4Rn0","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
