TaskRef: 'Fix incorrect render order in HeadingNavigator.tsx'

Learnings:
  - The original recursive `filterAndRenderHeadings` function in `HeadingNavigator.tsx` caused incorrect rendering order due to its depth-first traversal and conditional `CommandGroup` pushing.
  - Flattening the hierarchical `ITocItem` array into a single-level array while preserving the `depth` property allows for a simpler, linear filtering and rendering process.
  - Using `useCallback` for `getPrefix` and `flattenTocItems` ensures these utility functions are memoized and do not cause unnecessary re-renders.

Difficulties:
  - Ensuring the `depth` property was correctly used for UI indentation after flattening the structure. This was handled by applying `ml-` classes based on `item.depth` directly to `CommandItem`.

Successes:
  - Successfully refactored the `filterAndRenderHeadings` logic to first flatten the `tocItems` and then filter and render them, resolving the incorrect render order.
  - Maintained the visual indentation based on heading depth.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: For hierarchical data structures where filtering and linear rendering are required, flattening the structure first can simplify the rendering logic and ensure correct order.
