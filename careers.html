the majority of Dwarves Foundation employees work in Saigon, this section is written with that as the default. Some benefits don’t make sense in other countries. We will try our best to provide comparable benefits and perks as it makes sense, though.\n\n### Continuing Education Allowance\n\nYou will always grow by learning and playing with new and cool technologies. From books to conferences, you’ll get a yearly budget for your individual learning and development goals.\n\nIf you’re interested in taking classes that you feel improve you professionally or personally, you have a $300 annual stipend to do so. Some people take courses directly related to their career, while some take photography lessons or learn a musical instrument. It’s up to you; the point is to learn something that you feel enriches you as a person and employee.\n\n### Conference\n\nIn the case of conferences, the company will pay 50% of all expenses for approved job-related conferences and seminars. If you’re speaking at the conference, we’ll pay 100% of the expenses.\n\nTo get approval to attend a conference, submit a request to the Admin. In your request, provide as much detail as possible about the dates of the conference, your total expected out of office time, the costs of attending, the benefits expected to be gained by attending, any potential disruption to client work, etc.\n\n### Commission\n\nThe company will pay a commission on revenues it receives from each project which the employee procures. The commission will consist of 5% of the gross revenues for any sales. This may be split amongst multiple sales-people. A project does not have to have a sales-person.\n\n### Coworking Space\n\nIf working from home or a coffee shop doesn’t suit you, then trying a coworking space might do the trick. We support a $50/month stipend towards a desk in such a place in your city. Just make sure you’re using a true coworking space that’s meant solely for working, not a club or social space.\n\n### Remote Working\n\nWe encourage the team to work remotely. We want to build amazing things with autonomy, self-direction, and a healthy work-life balance. We offer flexible work schedules for all of our employees and unlimited PTO. We also believe that if a job allows for it, you should work wherever you are happiest.\n\nIt's also important to note this privilege is on a case-by-case basis and you need the approval from the lead.\n\n### Healthcare\n\nWe provide comprehensive medical and life insurance for our full-time members. We want to make sure that you don't have to worry about your life and contributing to things that matter. By default, we pay for the default package as provided by Vietnam regulation. If you are in need to upgrade the insurance package, you can talk to the Admin.\n\n### No Office Traps\n\nWe don't offer things like Foosball tables, catered meals in the office, and other “perks” designed to keep you at work for all of your waking hours. We were hoping you could put in 8 quality hours then go live your life, rest, and recharge so you can come back fresh to do it again.\n\n### Investment Time\n\nOn Fridays, we work to make ourselves, the company and our community better by learning new tools and techniques, working on open source, blogging, creating new products, volunteering our time, and more.\nThe more you contribute, the more bonus you get up to no limits.\n\n### Expense\n\nThe company will pay for any work-related expenses, such as software, or office supplies. If you have any doubts about whether or not to expense something, just ask. When you do buy something, get a receipt. Take a photo of that receipt, and send the photo to the Admin at \u003coperation@d.foundation\u003e for the reimbursements via the paycheck.\n\n### Employee Liquidity Pool\n\nIf Dwarves Foundation is ever sold or part of an IPO, tenured employees will be eligible to receive a portion of 5% of the value of the company. That 5% would be divided into units, based on the number of employees we have at the time. People who were at Dwarves Foundation for less than 1 year would receive 0 units, someone employed 1 year would receive 1 unit, and so on, until you’re fully vested at 5 years for 5 units.\n\n### Employee Stock Option Plan\n\nIf you don’t want to be just tenured employees, you can own the company. As part of the package, being the significant contributors will give you the right to buy a certain amount of company shares at a predetermined price. We will discuss on a case-by-case basis.\n\n### Employee Referral Bonus\n\nWe usually hire and to keep the quality bar, the Dwarves are encouraged to recommend friends that you think they match with the team. We believe your suggestions should be helpful as you have to know the person.\n\nThe company will pay a one month salary as a referral bonus to any employee who refers an applicant to our company who is hired by the company to a full-time position. The bonus is paid upon completion of the newly hired employee’s first 90 days of employment. The referring employee must still be employed with the company at the time the bonus is to be given.\n\n### Flexible Working Days\n\nFor a variety of reasons, people may choose to work fewer days per week than the usual Monday to Friday. It’s not encouraging but wherever possible we aim to enable this. Your paycheck and any bonus will be pro-rated as a percentage of a five day week. For example, if you opt to work 4 out of 5 days, your salary and any bonus would be reduced by 20%.\n\nPlease provide as much notice as you are able. Ideally two months or more for a change to your working patterns. It allows us to ensure that deliveries are resourced appropriately. As per our remote working policy, we encourage Fridays to be spent in the office wherever possible.\n\n### Flexible Working Hours\n\nWe care about the quality of the work we produce rather than the number of hours worked.\n\nWe do not have a specific start time. Likewise, there isn’t a time we expect everyone to leave the office. However we do have several meetings among the company, so you should get into the office or dial in before that time. We need to respect the team and our commitments so if we have a meeting booked for a certain time you are expected to be accommodating.\n\nIt's also important to note this privilege is on a case-by-case basis and you need the approval from the lead. It’s worth noting most of our employment contracts with staff do in fact have set contractual hours. This is so we can withdraw this privilege if necessary.\n\nFor some people that prefer to have a fixed working schedule, we recommend to start at 8 am and end at 5 pm.\n\n### Paid Time Off\n\nDwarves Foundation offers two weeks of paid vacation, a few extra personal days to use at your discretion, and the official national holidays every year. This is a guideline, so if you need a couple of extra days, no problem. We don’t track your days off; we use the honor system. Just make sure to check with your team before taking an extended absence, so they’re not left in the lurch.\n\nWe don’t track sick days either. If you’re under the weather, take the time you need to feel better. We recognize, too, that your mental health is just as important as your physical health. Consider taking a mental health day every now and again when you’re feeling overwhelmed or mentally fatigued.\n\n### Short-term Disability\n\nOn top of Paid Time Off, the company offers a self-funded short-term disability (STD) plan to all its employees. If you fall ill or injure yourself and are unable to work because of it, let us know, and you can take 30 days off at 75% pay. If after that, you’re still unable to work, the STD policy kicks in, and you’ll continue to earn 50% of your pay until you’re better, up to 3 months off. These days are an emergency reserve, in addition to your vacation/sick time described above. If after this period, you still cannot work, talk to your manager, An, or Han, and we will discuss what comes next on a case-by-case basis.\n\n### Sabbatical\n\nEvery three years, employees are eligible to take a one-month-long paid sabbatical. Just give a heads-up preferably three months in advance so that we can coordinate the work-load accordingly.\n\n### Parental Leave\n\nWhen you welcome a new child, we encourage you to take up to 16 weeks leave for primary caregivers and up to 2 weeks of discontinuity leave as a secondary caregiver at 100% paid salary. You may also choose to take an additional eight weeks to leave unpaid.\n","title":"Benefits And Perks","short_title":"","description":"Since the majority of Dwarves Foundation employees work in Saigon, this section is written with that as the default.

We started this team out of software practice advancement. The continuous study lays the foundation for the future growth. Just like software, knowledge must evolve and be useful. We collect the lesson learned and input into our [**team knowledge base**](https://github.com/dwarvesf/brain).\n\n## Purpose-built\nEverything we do comes with **[the purpose behind]().** Good software is software that works and provide actual value. Effort is count when it's placed on things that matter.\n\nThey are apps and systems for mass market. But they can also be a custom script to automate the build pipeline; a website for a non-profit organization, or an open source desktop app.\n\n## Effective \u003e Productive\nWe try to work on things that create the most value possible in a certain amount of time. Know your priority and do things that matter.\n\nBeing productive is about occupying your time—filling your schedule to the brim and getting as much done as you can.\n\nBeing effective is about finding more of your time unoccupied and open for other things besides work. We don't believe in busyness. We believe in effectiveness.\n\n## Keep it simple\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| So everyone could understand.

Make the 5% impossible possible.\n\nSpend a bit extra effort. Little things count. How you approach. How you solve or react to it. You'll be amazed by how effective it becomes by [going extra](https://memo.d.foundation/Go-the-extra-mile-4f4051d924444c62bb309cc4864b40df).\n\nSoftware gets updated to bring a better experience. That should applies in everything else. Every time you look back on your work, there should be something to improve.\n\n## Think long-term\nMaking any kind of actions, we think about the long-term effects. Every decision we make today can lead to an impact in the future. The technology we endorse, the solution we choose to solve the problem; The founder we backed, the startup we invest into; The people we work with, the way we handle the customers. It also includes how we talk about ourselves, the attitude toward peers.\n\n## Pay it forward\nGive before you get. We foster a place for collaboration and productivity, a pay-it-forward chain is vital. It's about passing on wisdom and taking the time to engage in valuable grasp for the less-experienced one.\n\nIt creates a culture of mentoring and ensures we're all moving forward.\n\n## Bond through goals\nWe move toward mutual goal. Having a share sense in goal drives us closer to success without distraction.\n\nThough the execution methods might be different, a consensus in goal will synchronize the output and get things done seamlessly.\n\n## Value the difference\nHaving multiple authenticity and the will to do right things helps us see differently with fisheye views.\n\nIt gives us more on what we currently know. We trust on that to diversify the team in knowledge base and social experience.\n\n## Making decision as team\nThe skillset is essential, but it isn't as important as vision and coordination.\n\nIt's ok to know more, but it's better to learn more. Everyone has something that they could improve upon, including yourself.\n\nBe supportive and values every decision as long as it contributes to the team benefit.\n\n## Thoughts on software\nSoftware is continuously changing the world. It's the tunnel to the future. One of our bet is on the Web3, the Open Internet and the next gen automation software using AI and Big Data.\n\nThat's happening and will continue to impact the entire world for the next 10 years. And with that believe, we want to be a one that construct the next future of things.\n\n## Engineering discipline\nSoftware engineering is about collaboration. It is what happens to programming when you add time and other programmers.\n\n**Discipline is required** to follow the flow. Not applying software engineering methods results in more expensive, less reliable software, and it can be vital in the long term.\n","title":"Culture Handbook","short_title":"","description":"Keep learning and growing.

We only hire people who tell us what to do, not the other way around. We always look for long-term teammates that why we want to ensure the new hire is a value fit and culture fit.\n\n### Rounds\n\nSeveral Dwarves will talk to the candidates to walk them through 4 rounds\n\n* Pre-assessment: We evaluate the logic, English, and the personalities in non-interrupted 30 minutes online test.\n* Assignment: Its objective is to gauge the candidate skills, give them an idea of how they approach tasks relevant to the job and provide us with some talking points.\n* Interview: In the 60-minute interview, the candidates would know more about Dwarves working style \u0026 philosophy, and impress us with their background and skills.\n* Culture: This is an occasion for the team to learn more about the candidates in a casual way.\n\n### We hire the manager of one\n\nWhat’s that mean? A manager of one is someone who comes up with their own goals and executes them. They don’t need heavy direction. They don’t require daily check-ins. They do what a manager would do — set the tone, assign items, determine what needs to get done, etc. — but they do it by themselves and for themselves.\nThese people free you from oversight. They set their direction. When you leave them alone, they surprise you with how much they’ve gotten done. They don’t need a lot of handholding or supervision.\n\nHow can you spot these people? Look at their history. Have they been self-sufficient at previous jobs? Have they defined their role before? Have they started their own site/company before? Or done their own thing in some other way? Find someone with initiative and a budding entrepreneurial spirit. And then nurture it.\nYou want someone who’s capable of building something from scratch and seeing it through. When you find these people, it frees up the rest of your team to work more and manage less.\n\n### Sideway Program\n\nThere are also two other programs that we hold bi-yearly in Spring and Summer.\n\n* The Internship program is for students with or without Engineering background from top universities.\n* The Apprenticeships are six-month paid career development programs for people with non-traditional technical backgrounds from underrepresented groups in tech.\n\nThose programs were designed with the purpose to give an opportunity for candidates to experience the real world projects. No coffee runs. We love watching talented people learn and explore their skills.\n\n![](assets/how-we-hire_internship-1.webp)\n\n### Referral\n\nWe usually hire and to keep the quality bar the Dwarves are encouraged to recommend friends that you think they match with the team. We think your suggestions should be helpful as you have to know the person.\n\nWe also want to spend the bonus on you rather than the headhunting agency. The company will pay a one month salary as a referral bonus to any employee who refers an applicant to our company who is hired by the company to a full-time position. The bonus is paid upon completion of the newly hired employee’s first 90 days of employment. The referring employee must still be employed with the company at the time the bonus is to be given.\n","title":"How we hire","short_title":"","description":"Hiring means we need help.

The way we see it is a collaboration between multiple people in the team with sufficient knowledge on the domain and clearly understand the project vision that they can quickly adapt to the changes in the market. We adopt the Agile philosophy at this level.\n\nAlso, based on that philosophy, we apply the Scrum framework, which we find out a good fit for us. There are no specific roles in the team at the beginning. There is only the team member who has autonomy and responsibility to meet the goals of the sprint. And there is the Scrum master who is the team member turning into a coach. He works to remove any impediments that are obstructing the team from achieving its sprint goals. The role was supposed to be temporary. A mature team doesn’t need a permanent coach.\n\n### Cycles\n\nWe work in an 8-week cycle at Dwarves Foundation. There are typically six cycles to a year. This fixed cadence serves to give us an internal sense of urgency, work as a scope hammer to keep projects from ballooning and provide a regular interval to decide what we’re working on.\n\nThe idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on has to take eight weeks or can be completed in that time. However, rather that we think about how we can break big projects into smaller ones that can be done in that amount of time, and that we bundle smaller things into a presentable scope of work that can be discussed.\n\nA budget thus limits work, and the budget focuses our discussion about what’s reasonable and what’s not. When a project starts slipping on its budget, the first approach should be to scope hammer the domain – and certainly not make it up by working more hours! Most things we work on can fit within eight weeks.\n\n### Cooldown\n\nIn between each cycle, we spend a week cooling down. That’s the time to deal with various backlogs or bug smashes, writing up what we worked on, and figuring out what we should tackle next. It’s some times tempting to add cooldown onto the end of the cycles, as a way to fit in more work. However, the goal is to resist this temptation. Yes, sometimes a little spill-over will happen, but it’s helpful to think about the end of the normal cycle as “pencils down.” That means that by week 4 of a normal cycle, we should be winding down, getting ready to launch, make sure QA is lined up, and all the other work that happens during and after the launch of new projects.\n\n### Meeting\n\nAll the meetings could be found on Basecamp Schedule.\n\n#### All-hands meeting\n\nThe all-hands meeting happens at the end of every cycle. The Dwarves look back and decide what to do next.\n\n#### Team meeting\n\nAt the same time, you are a member of either Programmer, Designer, Operation or Business team. We have a team meeting on the last Friday of the month to sit down together. This is the guideline so if in any particular circumstances the team lead can require to adjust the number of meetings.\n\n#### Project meeting\n\nEvery project has its meeting schedule. It should follow the company Cycles and Scrum guideline with at least Sprint Planning Meeting and Sprint Retrospective Meeting.\n\n### Communication\n\nIt’s hard to keep up on what everyone is doing and what it means if you just watch the stream of latest activity scrolling along in Basecamp. (It’s also a waste of time and source of stress to even try.) Instead, we have four chief mechanisms for keeping everyone in the loop about the work that’s going on.\n\nFirst, there’s the daily question of What did you work on today?, which supplies the nitty gritty details, but as a personal narrative. They’re a great conversation starter if you see someone working on something you either care about or want to learn more about. Please do use them as such! You’re obliged to answer this question at least twice a week when you’re not out.\n\nSecond, there’s the weekly question of What will you be working on this week?, which details your intentions for the coming week. Everyone is obliged to answer this question when they’re not out.\n\nThird, there are heartbeats. These are the team versions of What did you work on this cycle? This is where we summarize and celebrate the work that’s been done. Every team lead is obliged to write or designate someone on the team to write, this account one week after a cycle has ended.\n\nFourth, and finally, there are the kickoffs. These are the team version of What are you going to work on the next cycle? This is where the plan for the coming eight weeks is presented. Every team lead is obliged to write or designate someone on the team to write, this account before the start of the new cycle.\n\nThese mechanisms work together to free individuals and teams to run their days and cycles with confidence and independence. We have six opportunities per year to make big decisions about what to work on, and the rest of the time should chiefly be spent carrying out those short-term plans. By having clear expectations for communication, it’s easier for everyone to build trust in where we’re going and why.\n\n### Pitches\n\nWhether you work on product development or not, your voice and observations can help determine what we should be working on. The way to exert this influence is through pitches.\n\n**Write-up your idea of a new thing, an issue in daily work**, a change to a feature, or any other product development you think we should be considered as a fully considered post (the more specific, the better). This gives the whole company a chance to consider and respond to the idea, and then we’ll have the idea encapsulated in a post, available for reference at any time.\n\nThere’ll always be more pitches than we have time to field, though. So it’s important to have realistic expectations about what will happen after you posted your pitch. The default is simply that everyone involved with product development (and probably most everyone else in the company) will read and consider your pitch. That’s a win right there. Even if the full pitch doesn’t make it in, it can impact other product decisions by shining light on a weak point.\n\nHan and An is the team evaluating pitches for inclusion in the next cycle. Before the start of every cycle.\n\n### Raising an Issue\n\nFrom time to time people may have problems or concerns about their colleagues, customers, company leadership, work environment and so forth. We want everyone in the team to be empowered to raise an issue and have it dealt with swiftly and fairly.\n\n* Have a conversation with the person involved: The first thing you can do, if you feel comfortable and able, raises the issue directly with the person concerned. This direct and informal approach is encouraged, and we expect your colleagues who are approached responsibly to respond similarly. This approach may be particularly appropriate in dealing with matters of speech and expression, where individuals may not be aware that their behavior is causing distress.\n\n* Ask a colleague to intervene on your behalf: You may ask a colleague or leader to intervene informally on your behalf. In some situations, you may not feel able to approach the person or people involved directly and so going via a third party to raise your concern for you informally is another option available to you.\nIn particular, if you have a grievance with a leader and feel unable to raise it directly, you should raise this issue either with another leader or with a colleague who can raise it with a leader for you.\n\nIf they can’t help to resolve, you can talk to Han.\n\n### With managers of one\n\nManaging at Dwarves Foundation is a part-time occupation, next to being involved with doing the work itself. This means we rely on everyone at Dwarves Foundation to do a lot of self-management. People who do this well qualify as [managers of one](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one), and we strive for every one senior or above to embody this principle fully.\n\nThat means setting your direction when one isn’t given. Determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to. A manager of one will spend their time well when left to their own devices. There’s always more work to be done, always more initiatives to kick off, always more improvement to be had.\n\n### A typical working day\n\n* 9 am Monday, there is an Operation meeting between the head of all the team. They check up the status and list out what they need to do this week. Basecamp sends out the Digest email about recent activities. Basecamp start questioning “What will you be working on this week?”\n\n* 10 am Monday, there are several Sprint Planning meetings to get people on the ground if it is the first Monday of the sprint. People start working.\n* 12 pm, lunchtime and take a short break to 1 pm.\n* 3 pm Friday, the team close the sprint to do Retrospective meeting if it’s the last Friday of the sprint.\n* 4 pm Friday, there are several team meetings of Engineer and Design team if it’s the last Friday of the month.\n* 5 pm, Basecamp start questioning “What did you work on today?”\n* 6 pm, the Dwarves leave the office.\n\n### Remote\n\nWith the deep understanding that Work-Life balance is the real deal. We decided to pick this style of remote working as a primary way to work for the whole company. And everyone can choose to follow it or not. It’s optional but highly recommended.\n\nWe believe that a happy person can deliver 10x quality output compared to others. You cannot stay in the room all the time and can be creative at the same time. People should have the right to use the time of their own and to work anywhere as long as it does not violate the company values.\n\n \u003e We don’t want to manage your chairs.\n\nWe encourage the team to work remotely. We want our Dwarves to wake up at 7 am on the beach, grab a coffee and start doing the job that they love. Or spending the day in a coffee shop downtown to be more socialized. Or take their time to breathe the fresh air in Da Lat or Chiang Mai. Or the Dwarves can choose to stay at home with their kids at the cozy working corner to enjoy the alone-zone, best zone to focus and get things done.\n\n![](assets/how-we-work_remote-1.webp)\n\nIt's also important to note this privilege is on a case-by-case basis and you need the approval from the lead.\n\n### We head toward craftsmanship\n\nSoftware Craftsmanship is all about putting responsibility, professionalism, pragmatism and pride back into software development.\n\nCraftsmanship is not enough to guarantee the success of a project but the lack of it can be the main cause of its failure.\n","title":"How we work","short_title":"","description":"Hiring means we need help.

At both Amazon, Google and other companies, it’s [just around one year](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/career-management/tech-companies-have-highest-turnover-rate/). At Dwarves Foundation, it’s just around three years as of late 2018. That’s something to be proud of, and something to ensure endures. When you work at Dwarves Foundation, it should be feasible to think about this as the place for making a life-long career.\n\n## Mastery \u0026 Titles\n\nAdvancing your career at Dwarves Foundation doesn’t mean giving up on your craft and moving into “management.” Whether you work in programming, design, ops, support, or whatever, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way. This is especially important since we’re a relatively small company with just two layers of managerial cake: executives and team heads. And both the executives and heads still spend the majority of their time doing actual work themselves as well.\n\nWe’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to *six different levels*. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will, of course, be different. Here’s an example of the titles for programming:\n\n* Fresh Programmer\n* Junior Programmer\n* Programmer\n* Senior Programmer\n* Lead Programmer\n* Principal Programmer\n\nWhile this is how we recognize mastery, it’s by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a principal. We need people and perspectives from all levels of skill. Also, for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years, if not a decade+.\n\nHowever, these titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at Dwarves Foundation. Note that these titles are about a particular role *at Dwarves Foundation*. Someone may well have been a “Senior Designer” somewhere else with different assessment criteria and a different workflow, and then still start at Dwarves Foundation as a “Designer.” We recognize mastery and titles at Dwarves Foundation for the work done at Dwarves Foundation.\n\nDay to day, though, these titles aren’t much of a factor. However, they do give newcomers another way of orienting themselves at the company, and it gives everyone a clear idea of tracking their career progression.\n\nYou can see the specific titles and proficiencies expected for: [Programmers](/), [Designers](/), [Business](/).\n\n## Salary \u0026 Promotion\n\nYou get the paycheck on the 1st or the 15th of the month depend on your joined day.\n\nEveryone in the same role at the same level is paid the same at Dwarves Foundation. When someone gets a promotion, that goes from one level to the next, they’ll get a corresponding pay raise Mar 1st as well.\n\nThe payroll fund is always reversed at 50% of total revenue. We always try to pays at the top 20% for our industry salary levels. The comparison data is provided by market research company, e.g., Adecco in Vietnam, that polls compensation data from all the major companies in our industry and plenty of our smaller peers as well. \n\nThe data is reviewed once per year at the end of January. If it’s warranted, that is if the market rates have gone up, we’ll increase pay on Mar 1st to follow suit. We don’t decrease payment, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, we’ll hold them steady until they come up again.\n\nPayroll is run by An, and Han does the transfer. If you’ve got a query on your salary, you can talk to An.\n\n## Performance Review\n\nWe perform bi-yearly reviews in July and January. Everyone who has been with the company at least 90 days and completed the [IDP batch](how-we-work.md#idp) gets a review. The primary purpose of these reviews is to give feedback on career path advancement and recognize accomplishments. We wrap up our January reviews in time to make promotion related pay adjustments effective January 1st. We follow a simple process:\n\n* Everyone writes up a 1-2 page summary and sends it to the head of their team.\n* The head of your team reviews your summary and prepares their thoughts.  He schedules a one-hour meeting to discuss.\n\nThe head of your team will reach out to you when it’s time for you to write up your review. Of course, you can (and should) ask for feedback as often as you’d like it. The Performance Indicator is usually the summary of *Responsible, Teamwork and Mastery.*\n","title":"Making a career","short_title":"","description":"Advancing your career at Dwarves Foundation doesn’t mean giving up on your craft and moving into “management.” Whether you work in programming, design, ops, support, or whatever, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way.","tags":["team","performance","hiring","career"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["han"],"date":"Fri Dec 15 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"careers/additional-info/making-a-career.md","slugArray":["careers","additional-info","making-a-career"]},{"content":"\n## Aim for Quality\n\nQuality exists in every piece of work.

Recognize the waste, and eliminate it.\n\n**Constantly Delivery**\n\nMake it work. First do it, then do it right, then do it better. The sooner we deliver, the sooner feedback can be received. That's how things evolve with enhancements.\n\n**Towards Simplicity**\n\nWhen things get hard, go simply. It's even harder than complex. We write code for humans not machines. We want readability. Readable means Reliable. It's understandable, workable, and maintainable.\n\n**Effective \u003e Productive**\n\nProductivity is filling your schedule \u0026 getting as much done as you can. It's busyness and we don't trust that. Effectiveness is better. It's finding more of unoccupied time and open for other things besides work. Know your priority. Do things that matter.\n\n**Fail Fast, Learn Often**\n\nEvaluate your work constantly. Start again if you have to. Starting from scratch lets innovation comes organically inspired by previous experiences. Evaluate your work constantly.\n\n## Agile at Dwarves\n\n|                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                     |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Continuous Improvement**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Story, Planning, Sprint\u003cbr\u003e- Daily Standup\u003cbr\u003e- Retrospective            | **Lean Thinking**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- People first\u003cbr\u003e- Value-oriented\u003cbr\u003e- Eliminating waste                                  |\n| **Delivery Pipeline**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Continuous Exploration\u003cbr\u003e- Continuous Integration\u003cbr\u003e- Continuous Deployment | **Highlight Innovation**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Empower creativity\u003cbr\u003e- Validate with customers\u003cbr\u003e- Pivot without mercy or guilt |\n","title":"The Manifesto","short_title":"","description":"Quality exists in every piece of work.

There are many startups found and raise fund every day. They focus on making significant positive changes, impact millions of people, lead to breakthroughs and support the foundation of economic growth.\n\nBuilding an innovation startup requires lots of different things, and it is tough. Most of them have to deal with business development, legal, fundraising, team recruitment, and product development at the same time. Tech startups need to move fast and break things.\n\nAt some points, growing a startup needs a strong and experienced team behind. The software team that can help to design the system, design the database, produce the well-crafted software, keep the system stable, avoid the technical debt and deliver values is one of the critical pieces to solve the puzzle.\n\nAnother motivation for Dwarves Foundation was the lack of respect that service firms receive. Most software companies out there focus on digital transformation and consultancy. The nature of the business with a tight deadline and budget force them to do tricks. They hit and run. The codebase and software they produced are full of crap, and it damages our pride.\n\n**This is where Dwarves Foundation comes in.**\n\nDespite the fact that service firms scale linearly, their ultimate size is capped and small, they don’t have life-changing exits for their founders, we start Dwarves Foundation as we want to build things right. I’ve always felt that companies like Dwarves Foundation are more important to the economy than the mildly pejorative phrase used to describe them.\n\n**Dwarves Foundation is an innovation service firm**.\n\n We have been building an organization with high standard software practices and business growth capabilities, helping tech startups, entrepreneurs and makers deliver their innovative software product since 2013.\n\n**We stand for the craftsmanship in software development**.\n\nMore than telling people how to do things, as a firm, we take responsibility for collaboratively creating the product of innovation with the client. We value the long-term partnership, and we brought the economic impact through massive product distribution and brought to the market by the clients.\n\nThis is what we do here. It takes many forms, and we’re always working towards better software craftsmanship.\n\n## The name: Dwarves\n\n![](assets/what-we-stand-for_yggdrasill-1.webp)\n\nIt begins in Norse Mythology. After the executed of Ymir, the very first giant of the universe, by Odin has conceived a whole new universe. In the new world, Yggdrasill is a giant ash tree located at the center cradles the nine realms of the cosmos.\n\nDwarf is the small and misshapen creatures that originated as maggots from Ymir’s corpse. They dwell in the mountains deep down in the dark underground of **Svartalfheim**. Dwarves are wisdom, natural good at smithing, mining, and crafting. They are well known for being the best blacksmiths throughout the nine worlds, not only do they have natural abilities to craft weapons and jewelry. They are also excellent engineers and architects.\n\nDwarvish magic was fundamentally technological know how. They had an unusually high level of skill. There was no shimmering light around the Dwarves, just first rate workmanship. Dwarves greatly pride themselves in their craftsmanship, be it smithing or anything else.\n\nThe dwarf is an example of a creature who has the ability that surpasses the known world, presaging the rise of a universe beyond this physical realm. Whatever their origin, the dwarf’s existence plays a role in expanding the imagination.\n\nAspiring to create a positive breakthrough that can be able to rewrite the new world, we chose the name Dwarves Foundation as the commitment to the vision that we follow.\n\nAt our woodland, the Dwarves are encouraged to thoroughly assess and evaluate the product quality before handing it to the customers. By participate in every detail of the work, we take craftsmanship as one of the most fundamental factors of the career transformation for engineers. World-class products require world-class engineers and craftsmanship is what makes it done. Craftsmanship is what flows among the team spirit, or does not exist at all.\n\nWe choose innovation to be one of our core values that form ideas to affect the general society undoubtedly. Innovation is not for geniuses working alone, it is an activity that requires the team effort. Being innovative is a part to approach the new era. What that rewards, what can I say, can genuinely lead to significantly remodel the cosmo.\n\n![](assets/what-we-stand-for_dwarves-1.webp)","title":"What we stand for","short_title":"","description":"More than telling people how to do things, as a firm, we take responsibility for collaboratively creating the product of innovation with the client.

The value is important to us. They are what we proud of. They help guide us when we are facing a difficult decision. They will be the things you like about what we do at Dwarves Foundation and how we do it.\n\nOur core values guide our strategies and individual actions so that we create a company whose character is as radical as our work.\n\n* **Craftsmanship**: We work toward perfection in every single piece that we produce. We are proud of the well-crafted software that we develop together.\n* **Teamwork**: Teamwork is all about trust and collaboration. Having someone in the team mean we can rely on this person.\n* **Sustainable**: We think long-term. We do not believe in rushing for project and working overtime. We believe in working sustainably and balanced so that we are a happy bunch of sane workers. Software requires good brains to create good codes and good processes.\n\n## Culture Code\n\nThere is no such specific guide for culture code. So many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they actually do. That’s a sham. Let’s not write a handbook like that. **Let’s keep it honest.**\n\nWe believe the culture is defined by whom we hire, what we promote and encourage. It is dynamic, and it should expand like our business. We welcome its change as long as we still stay on the ground. Just like we want people to contribute new skills and ideas, we want people to contribute to the new culture.\n\n![](assets/what-we-value_culture-1.webp)\n\nA few things that we observed over the last few years:\n\n* [No asshole rules](https://www.amazon.com/Asshole-Rule-Civilized-Workplace-Surviving/dp/0446698202): no matter how great a candidate may be, being an asshole is an automatic deal breaker.\n* False Positives are ok, False Negatives are not: we prefer to not have you in the team rather than let a wrong person affect the others.\n* We love celebration: the Dwarves usually take chances to celebrate with you whether it’s your birthday or you have some good news.\n* Knowledge sharing: every day we learn something new, and we would love to share it with the whole team even though it’s not relevant to you. We post it there.\n","title":"What we value","short_title":"","description":"Before anything else, values come first. The value is important to us. They are what we proud of.

We offer study groups and blockchain-based projects for peeps to grow and catch up with this rising trend. Thanh is one of the vital elements of this team; and we know he’ll be more than happy to have you onboard.\n\n### What raises your interest for Dwarves?\n“My path at Dwarves began with the zeal to develop web3 and blockchain products. It's the rising star of modern software. The ecosystem revolves around cryptocurrency, NFTs, games, trading platforms and everything in between.\n\nBlockchain projects at Dwarves stretch to different potential corners of web3, from trading platforms to blockchain games. All of this call for comprehension of cross-chain and swapping technique.\n\n![](assets/df-apprenticeship-2022-meet-the-mentors-ngoc-thanh-pham_df-apprenticeship-2022---meet-the-mentors-ngoc-thanh-pham_6200459018d58aabbad34c4dea3d42c7_md5.webp)\n\nTo seamlessly craft an output with a deliverable quality, understanding the product requirements is a sine qua non.”\n\n### Do you think blockchain knowledge is critical to engineer's career paths?\n“Having quite an experience working with blockchain, it came to my acknowledgement: This technology means more than just a framework to resolve the business problem. It no longer stays as a platform where you build and develop an application. Blockchain offers an open platform and foundation to create a decentralized application and its ecosystem.\n\nThe foundation of blockchain derives from the backend technique. But as time goes by, its potential bypasses all the ongoing notions of software engineering. From what I concept, once people place reliance on blockchain technology and its ability, it grows as a burgeoning software foundation. This opens another career path alongside frontend or backend engineering. It's an alternative to explore and surpass one's seniority.”\n\n### Say, an engineer is ready to get started with blockchain. What key factor he should note?\n“What caught my interest in the current youngsters is their proficiency in picking up new things. Some only need a few months to enroll and start their career with blockchain. This also brings a downside. They dive in too fast, get things done and somehow forget the critical factor of making a decent product: The long-term value.\n\nBlockchain requires a level of accuracy and meticulousness. That comes with a logical mindset and testing approach to deliver a product that brings value. This concept must be grasped before you design, test and validate any model.”\n\n### What makes a product reach its definition of success?\n“For a product to succeed, it must first solve a user's need. No matter what you're building, a utility, a platform or an application, that product should empower the company revenue and align with the business goal. It's a target an engineer seeks to meet when he gets hands-on developing anything.”\n\n### Your secret sauce as a mentor?\n“I understand the urge to rush into something and want to excel it in no time. Rome wasn't built in a day. It's a mentor's mission to soothe down a hustle mentee and coach them to take one thing at a time. This forms a habit of paying attention to details and knows exactly what went wrong when an issue shows up.\n\nLearning on the job can't give you everything. Cloning a project source code and editing it refrains one from acknowledging where the error came from. Combine the best practices, project experiences, research and document them all. It provides a bird-eye view for the big picture, and you'll know why you do this.”\n\n---\n\nDwarves Foundation Apprenticeship 2022 is a 6-month fully paid work-study-train program to shape your software skills and define your career path.

There were both positive and constructive feedback. The best part was knowing how Apprentices were able to advance and hone their skills.\n\n* **Knowledge Upgrade**: Apprentices were asked to systemize the foundation and learn about the latest best practices of software development.\n* **Continuous Learning**: Besides project works, apprentices must pick their own domain of interest, learn then share back with the team. Our learning \u0026 discussion rooms on Discord were piled up with programming tips and #TILs.\n* **Career Path**: Most Apprentices get a more defined view on their career growth. As a highlight, a DS and a Fullstack developer have chosen to switch their path into Backend. It’s interesting and exciting for not the peeps themselves, but for us as well.\n* **Engineering Principle**: Engineering mindset was enforced at all phases, nurturing a protocol to be responsible and harness a sense of ownership of what they do.\n* **Guiding Method**: Instead of the traditional mentor-mentee method, we’d prefer a peer-to-peer collaboration. Apprentices are trusted with their work and free to raise their ideas.\n* **Teamwork Mindset**: Regardless of roles and seniorities, we provide the absolute support for those who need it.\n\n![](assets/dwarves-foundation-apprenticeship-batch-of-2022_9726985cf7f5aabace53ea202291bdc3_md5.webp)\n\n### The next roster\n\n#### Fostering a data team\n\nAs stated in the latest [Dwarves Updates](https://log.d.foundation/06d0a46163914f10831d3146867dde2d#4139ec11dc0e401f8349e481934d3b9c), our bet goes for data, due to its high demand in engineers, and the powerful value data brings to solve complex business problems.\n\nThe data market is full of potential, but the number of good data engineers and analysts is still few and far between.

We want to make sure that you don't have to worry about your life and contributing to things that matter.\n\n### Stay Fresh\nWork is a marathon, not a sprint. We work a sustainable pace of 40 hours a week, with the occasional emergency or once-every-few-years special push demanding more.\n\n### No Office Traps\nWe don't offer things like Foosball tables, catered meals in the office, and other “perks” designed to keep you at work for all of your waking hours. We were hoping you could put in 8 quality hours then go live your life, rest, and recharge so you can come back fresh to do it again.\n\n### Employee Stock Option Plan\nIf you don’t want to be just tenured employees, you can own the company. As part of the package, being the significant contributors will give you the right to buy a certain amount of company shares at a predetermined price. We will discuss on a case-by-case basis.\n\n### Flexible Working Hours\nWe care about the quality of the work we produce rather than the number of hours worked. We do not have a specific start time. Likewise, there isn’t a time we expect everyone to leave the office. However we do have several meetings among the company, so you should get into the office or dial in before that time. We need to respect the team and our commitments so if we have a meeting booked for a certain time you are expected to be accommodating. \n\n### Paid Time Off\nDwarves Foundation offers two weeks of paid vacation, a few extra personal days to use at your discretion, and the official national holidays every year. This is a guideline, so if you need a couple of extra days, no problem. We don’t track your days off; we use the honor system. Just make sure to check with your team before taking an extended absence, so they’re not left in the lurch.\n\nAnd more at [Benefits \u0026 Perks](../additional-info/benefits-and-perks.md)\n\n![](assets/team.png)\n\n## How to be a dwarf?\nYou can [**apply here**](https://dwarves.careers/jobs/software-engineer-front-end--dwarves-foundation--saigon/) or you can send us your **short CV** or any similar piece of information at [spawn@d.foundation](mailtospawnd.foundation) with \n\n \u003e \n \u003e Subject: Frontend - Be an awesome dwarf\n\nWe are expecting **Your application form**\n\n* Who you are and what have you been working on\n* More detailed info related to the position you're applying for\n* Make sure you enter links to your public profiles (i.e. Linkedin, Twitter, GitHub, personal Blog...)\n* Don't forget to attach portfolio of projects you've been working on (ideally with links for AppStore/PlayStore)\n* Attach references, if you have any\n\nHonestly, we don't really care about your level of formal education, math skill, or so on.

[@antran](https://memo.d.foundation/contributor/antran), Senior Software Engineer with 7 years of experience working from start-ups to Project Lead at Dwarves Foundation. \n\nBefore joining Dwarves, [@antran](https://memo.d.foundation/contributor/antran) held the position of Tech Lead at a start-up and remote Frontend Lead for a company in the US. After giving himself 3 months of rest, An joined Dwarves' Gravity project, becoming a full-time engineer and lead builder of the project.\n\nTo An, things would become quite boring if they were only focused on Frontend. If you get too familiar with one fixed thing and don't expand into many other aspects, work will no longer be interesting. He has worked in many roles, from Android to Web, from Backend to Frontend. So the title Full-stack Engineer is somehow still true for this Senior. \n\n![](assets/life-at-dwarves-with-an-tran_the-more-you-challenge-yourself-the-more-exciting-it-gets-an-tran_life-at-dwarves-with-an-tran-the-more-you-challenge-yourself-the-more-exciting-it-gets_9e2ac4cd6681cdf0a45399021f20a4cd_md5.webp)\n\n### What does it take for An to become a Senior?\n\n“If others need advice, I also give my own perspective and personal experience. I build trust with them, as that is how I leave an impact in my role as a guiding figure.”\n\n### How does being a Senior at Dwarves differ from previous companies?\n\n“Each project comes with its own difficulties and responsibilities. I will have to find ways to adapt to the project and determine the approach to meet the client's requirements in any given environment.\n\nDuring the initial phase of building Nghe Nhan system, our team had limited resources. The client's demands had to be balanced with the speed of delivery given the available resources. It was indeed a challenge. From planning and task allocation within the team to ensuring the quality of our work and the final product.\n\nNghe Nhan system is more complex than previous projects. I have to strike a balance between keeping up with the customer's pace as new features are continuously added. I need to ensure that the client understands that pushing for faster product development can sometimes be challenging in terms of maintaining quality. Working at Dwarves, especially in a senior role, presents various challenging scenarios for me to learn from and enhance my capabilities.”\n\n### What is your opinion of a true Senior?\n\n“I believe that I can learn a great deal from a genuine Senior. From task management, team communication, to problem-solving and providing solutions, there is much to gain. The clearest indication of working with a true Senior is the sense of comfort. They would be the first person I think of when encountering difficulties.“\n\n![](assets/life-at-dwarves-with-an-tran_the-more-you-challenge-yourself-the-more-exciting-it-gets-an-tran_96b7765a-86b3-43d2-8f4a-8ee09d21b695.webp)\n\n### Dwarves is a fast-paced environment where things can get chaotic for Seniors who have many responsibilities. How do you manage your own tasks and teammates?\n\n“I realize that leading someone who is fresh out of school can have a big impact on their career path. Working together for a long time, their working style may start to resemble mine, and even their code style may reflect my mindset. I believe that is how I leave an influence in my role as a trailblazer.\n\nIf you need advice or want to learn something specific or take additional courses to enhance your knowledge, I can provide you with my perspective. I share my insights and experiences based on what I have personally gone through. I won't share if I haven't experienced it myself. There's no secret formula, but I aim to build trust with you. Once you trust me, you'll be more inclined to listen to my advice”.\n\n---\n**Life at Dwarves** is a series of stories about people, perspectives and lives at the Dwarves Foundation.\n","title":"Meet An Tran: Senior engineer's growth journey","short_title":"An Tran","description":"Life at Dwarves 01 is a rather secretive member with a healthy life and gentle personality.

Our workload depends on each project. A person can take care of both UX and UI design if the project is small. As a product designer, you're expected to know both.\n\nI've been with the Dwarves for 5 years already. Graduated as a Graphic Designer and after 2 years working on this, I didn't feel so good about my career path. There are just too many designers in this sector. By that time, UX \u0026 UI were becoming a thing. People started to know about it. So I decided to try it out. As graphic designers, you're welcome to work on ideas \u0026 creativity. But product designers are bound with technology, rules and terms. It was rough at first, but my decision stayed solid.”\n\n### It’s the environment that matters.\n“Newbies usually seek big firms or local companies to start their careers. Since those corps have been structuring their projects, everything was well-developed. Our job was only to maintain and update. But somehow, this blocks me from learning and exploring. I used to jump between 2-3 local corporations since I couldn't find a fitting place to grow in UI \u0026 UX design. That's when HR reached out to me, and I knew about Dwarves.\nAt the moment, Dwarves was still a startup. This gave me more opportunities to learn since all our projects are brand new. Dwarves have chosen hard mode since then. They were always ahead of their game, and I learned a lot from them.

It took people a while to cope with the whole work-from-home mode. But I'm glad everyone was able to catch up with the productivity.\nIt's a great experience working here. The journey includes high notes and little stuff that gets on my nerves. \n\nThere are times that people have their subjective opinions and are ready to protect them. I used to be the only designer on the team. That makes the communication issue between me with the rest of the developer team much harder. Our work scope is different, and so are our perspectives. We ended up arguing over everything. \n\nSo the team began to hold seminars, mostly to remove the roadblock once a for all. I got the chance to explain my work as a designer and understand things from a developer's point of view. It helped us to walk in each other's shoes. That move revamped our collaboration real fast.

Starting out remotely, Dat soon saw the benefits of Dwarves’ hybrid working model. With guidance from [@tom](https://memo.d.foundation/contributor/tom) and others, he’s been able to dive into real-world learning, picking up skills on the go. Dat’s journey is all about practical experience, quick exchanges, and real teamwork - exactly how we like to do things here.\n\n### Learning by doing at Dwarves\nStarting at Dwarves remotely, I dove into LLM/AI. Remote work gave me focus, but being in the office changed everything. Learning here doesn’t happen through formal meetings - it’s quick, spontaneous exchanges with everyone, from CEO to teammates.\n\n### Real-time learning at the office\nHybrid work became a quicker way to learn. In the office, instant feedback and casual conversations on LLM trends pushed my understanding forward much faster than working alone at home.\n\n\u003e “The quick chats turn into real learning moments. In an environment where mentors and seniors are always learning, newbies feel encouraged to do the same. It’s all rooted in Dwarves’ mentorship culture.”\n\u003e \n\nOne time, I was stuck on an LLM model, and a quick whiteboard session with [@tom](https://memo.d.foundation/contributor/tom) and the team solved it in minutes, saving me hours of trial and error.\n\n![](assets/life-at-dwarves-dat-nguyen.jpg)\n\n### Learning by watching and doing\nObserving how others, like [@tom](https://memo.d.foundation/contributor/tom) or CEO, handled challenges taught me more than online guides, my learning feel more real. One session where my mentor optimized code gave me insights I couldn’t have gained from remote tutorials.\n\nSeeing everyone solve problems in real-time helped me grasp things much faster. Working on projects with input from different team members broadened my view on how to collaborate effectively.\n\n### The value of being face-to-face\nLearning here happens naturally. Everyone shares what they know through the work itself. No formal lessons needed - just quick exchanges and hands-on collaboration. Being in the office helped me sharpen skills that are harder to develop remotely, like thinking on my feet.\n\n### Growing with the whole team\nThe hybrid setup offers the best of both worlds. I can focus remotely but get that extra boost from being in the office when needed. The goal is simple - helping each other improve and push forward, with support from the entire team along the way.\n","title":"Meet Dat Nguyen: AI Dev Intern on hybrid working at Dwarves","short_title":"Dat Nguyen","description":"Dat Nguyen’s journey as an AI/LLM intern at Dwarves, where hybrid working and hands-on learning create real growth.

Through Aharooms project, his interest for Golang began. After 3 years, it’s not just the programming language that he was fond of, but also the human and culture at Dwarves that led to his decision: To go further with Dwarves for its human and the exclusive learning culture.\n\n### Python, Java or NodeJS? Golang!\n“Back in 2017, Japanese companies were highly rated. People strived to go for it. Of course, I wasn't an exception. I tried my luck by applying for a Japanese tech firm. They required an entrance test using the Golang language, which I had no idea about. They gave us a 1-week deadline to learn and complete the exercise. I failed, obviously. But I had no regret. That test, by all means, sparked my lucky charm with Golang.\n\nI started working on the Aharooms project before eventually moving on to Dwarves. I was able to learn more about NodeJS, but it was Aharooms that gave me the chance to learn and practice Golang. The excitement escalated, and I knew this should be my go-to language. \n\nWhy not Python or Java? The simplicity and efficiency I found in Golang are unbeatable. The language granted me the joy to work with, and empowered my productivity. It was beyond any language I've ever been with. \n\nFrom what I concept, Golang's future development is very promising, as more and more companies and startups incorporate Golang into their projects. More specifically, Go's adaptability is ideal for creating and developing cloud-native applications. \n\nIt was indeed a bit confusing when you first approached a new language. The willingness to learn, and the time spent to find a solution matter a lot. Don't force yourself if you have explored and practiced with a programming language and don't enjoy working with it. Find the language you love, and seek projects in which you can participate all you've learned.”\n\n### It’s normal to be ‘inexperienced’.\n\"Even though I am an instructor for interns, I often see and refer to myself as a supporter. Most interns have quite a bit of prior experience, and I need to hone my skills to become a better mentor. \n\nAnother issue I discovered is that recently, fresh graduates are afraid to apply to large corporations due to their lack of experience. But it's normal to be inexperienced! The important thing is the knowledge you acquired during school. \n\nUse that as your confidence to gain your first job.\" Stay hungry, and stay foolish. At the same time, ask yourself what type of person you want to be in the future. Whether being an \"indie hacker\" or a self-employed, you should constantly improve your skills and industry expertise, as well as network to expand relationships.”\n\n### It's the people and its culture that keep me at Dwarves.\n\"During my internship at KMS in 2017, only two people were on the team: The leader and I. As everything was already built, our daily job was to maintain the application. After a month, the leader thought I could do it alone, so he left the team to join another. I soon realized that I preferred working in a team to build a product from scratch rather than working alone. \n\nBy 2019, I had met and worked on the same project with my Dwarves teammates, and everyone had become an inspiration to me in my work; each with an outstanding personality. I always learned something worthwhile from everyone to help improve myself. When I interact with Hieu Phan, his pleasant humor makes me feel close, easy to talk to, and unafraid to share the general grasp. Thanh Pham, despite his being harsh and strict, is often concerned with the teammate's career direction. His biggest strength is to offer advice to every teammate and junior. Bao, on the other hand, is the type of person who sees the bigger picture. And Minh is best known for his work project management skill and dedication. \n\nIt's always the calm ocean before every storm. There comes the point that it hits me: \"Why does my day revolve around code? Am I still living like this from now on?\". The questions, eventually, shoved me deeper into what they call 'the mid-life crisis\" And I had to figure my way out. I began to expand my interest area, starting with financial investment \u0026 self-development. None of that would have ever happened if it were not for the guys' input, which I'll always appreciate. \n\nEarlier this year, a client offered me a full-time employment package. A bigger place to grow comes with a new benefit. It's a risky decision to take that leap - I know. But at the end of the day, I chose to stay with Dwarves. I value its remote culture. Part of me wants to take up more challenges here, to grow from its work-ownership principle and the habit of continuous learning. \nIf I take that offer, my life will become a 9-to-5 circle. Everything is settled to get up and work, and it bores me out. Those Radio Talks and sharing offer me two values I'm seeking: \n\nTo interact with people and to learn from them. Folks at Dwarves are more knowledgeable as a result of those sessions. So perhaps, teammates and culture are what connect and keep me staying. \n\n![](assets/life-at-dwarves-with-hieu-vu_27fe0d8a27cb8fd173cf17003989cd7e_md5.webp)\n\nAfter three years working here, I grew from someone who would not dare to speak to anyone to a person who can now confidently convey his experience and knowledge to interns. That's also the most challenging aspect of being an intern supporter: Learning to understand people's wants and needs and how to provide the most efficient support.\"\n\nSwing by our Discord to meet \u0026 chat with Hieu Vu and the rest of Dwarves team: [https://discord.gg/dwarvesv](https://discord.gg/dwarvesv).\n\n---\n**Life at Dwarves** is a series of stories about people, perspectives and lives at the Dwarves Foundation.\n","title":"Meet Hieu Vu: Golang passion and Dwarves community","short_title":"Hieu Vu","description":"Life at Dwarves 06 is all about how Hieu Vu picked up Golang as his favorite programming, and how human factor happens to be the key element that ties him with Dwarves.","tags":["life-at-dwarves","software","career"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["innno_","duy"],"date":"Wed Aug 24 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"careers/life/hieu-vu.md","slugArray":["careers","life","hieu-vu"]},{"content":"\n\u003e\n\u003e \"The process of transformation and progress will never be easy, but you need it for a better version\".\n\n**Life at Dwarves #5** is the career story of [@nam](https://github.com/namnhce), the Dwarves's DevOps Engineer.

Listening to his sharing, we hope you might feel like we do, that Nam has always been and will be the key player who would strive to deliver his best.\n\n### Joining Dwarves? A roller coaster ride.\n\"2017 marked my first milestone with Dwarves. One of my friends asked me if I wanted to be part of a team that worked on cool projects and surrounded by like-minded peeps. I said yes, without a second thought. Looking back now, it must have been fate. Because my 2017 version was still figuring out how to finish the university degree. Joining any firm as a full-time job can't be the right move.\n\nI became a full-time FE after 4 months of part-time work. Dwarves didn't have any QC at that time besides Huy Tieu, and he became my mentor soon after that. I have worked in various engineering aspects, from Frontend to QC, Backend to DevOps. Until I joined Aharooms, where I finally decided to act as a Backend Engineer.\"\n\n### Define. Grow. Complete.\n\"The peers my age tend to throw themselves into gym, movies or dining after work to blow off some steam. And they do that on a schedule. A schedule that I refuse to follow, mostly because I'm used to living as someone who prefers to do things alone. I find it hard to confine myself to meeting the same people, and doing the same thing on a specific timeline.\n\n2019 was when I finally let myself try out new things in different settings. Staying at home too long shrinks my comfort zone, so I need to push myself out of it. That's when I signed up for GopherCon 2018 \u0026 2019. The goal was not only to do another team thing but it also to observe and understand how a well-organized event works from A to Z.\n\nThe most intrigued aspect as an organizer is to take the initiative to work with merchandisers, contact and arrange the guest speaker's schedule. Thanks to those experiences, I was able to acknowledge what needs to be improved in my communication skill and was more open to expanding the social connection.\n\nBy that time, I was still one of the team's youngest members. So part of the motivation was to catch up with the rest of the group - those terrific in soft skills. Event-organizing work was how I practiced and grew to complete myself.\"\n\n![](assets/life-at-dwarves-with-nam-nguyen-keep-pushing-oneself-towards-goal_d6b7f9003146b59e78897e98860ae7fb_md5.webp)\n\n### The 200% motto.\n\"My trait of having an eye for details sometimes leads to slower productivity. Thus, I'm still today-year-old thriving to optimize it. While I was still working on Aharooms, staying up working until 1 or 2 AM was an everyday scheme. It bugs me to go to bed knowing I haven't finished the work. It's a principle to work with all I can, despite the role I'm playing as. Looking back at my 2017 version, I've always been amazed by what has been learned and changed.\n\nLast July rounded up my 5th year as a Dwarves. It was one hell of a roller coaster ride. I play by a motto where I'm down to perform at a 200% effort. I guess that motto layers my success at Open Fabric, a recently-wrapped up project where the teammates and the Project Lead himself endorsed me for being an absolute rock star. It's hard to describe the feeling, but 'proud' would be the right word.\n\nDwarves is scaling up and getting bigger every day. So as a long-time contributor, the newbies would come and ask me how to upgrade their career and self-development. I often come with this: Give yourself the chance to try, and try out everything until you find something you wouldn't trade the world for. Keep up the consistency in what you choose. On top of that, don't force yourself to work on what you hate. Meeting new people will outgrow you. And remember to spend good times with the colleagues, because that can be one of the best moments you remember about that place.\"\n\n![nam](assets/life-at-dwarves-with-nam-nguyen-keep-pushing-oneself-towards-goal_7a80737e168731ddb08a001e5a9d4062_md5.webp)\n\n---\n**Life at Dwarves** is a series of stories about people, perspectives and lives at the Dwarves Foundation.\n","title":"Meet Nam Nguyen: From Frontend to DevOps - A journey of continuous growth","short_title":"Nam Nguyen","description":"Life at Dwarves 05 is the career story of Nam, the Dwarves's DevOps Engineer.

While there is no predetermined path or set of qualifications, several key abilities can help engineers gain the knowledge and experience to advance as architects. Becoming a strong software architect is more about applying skills in practice than just gaining theoretical knowledge. \n\n### Welcoming All Team Members: Embracing Diversity and Inclusivity.\nOutside of work, we encourage the Dwarves to improve their knowledge and skills. Software Design Group - where people can develop themselves and as a team, where the team discusses and collects the point of view on software systems. \n\nBy thriving on diversity, Dwarves welcomes professionals from various backgrounds, skill sets, and experiences to join us, learn with us, and build with us. We embrace inclusivity promote the exchange of fresh ideas, encourage creativity, and help to foster a sense of belonging among team members. \n\n### Developing Skills and Professional Knowledge: Continuous Growth and Mastery.\nAfter every training session, there was both positive and constructive feedback from the team. The best part was knowing how they were able to advance and hone their skills.\n\n* **Develop a broad technical perspective:** Through the ongoing training, team members were asked to understand how technologies, frameworks, and languages work together at an enterprise level. They should keep up with software trends to see how new tools could benefit their organization.\n* **Gain experience with system design:** Designing complex system architectures is at the heart of a software architect's job. The team members themselves have experience in creating scalable, practical software designs and understanding the performance demands to build knowledge that translates directly to architectural work.\n* **Develop a user experience mindset:** Providing a good user experience was enforced at all phases. This focus on user experience (UX) encourages team members to put themselves in the shoes of the end-users and consider the impact of their work on the overall usability, accessibility, and satisfaction of the software.\n* **Teamwork mindset:** Regardless of roles and seniority, the collaboration between individuals in the team was evident, with everyone clearly understanding their responsibilities and working together effectively.\n\n### Level Up the Tech Quality\nWe build software. The primary purpose of the Software Design Group is to create high-quality software solutions. Software architects need to be hands-on, we input the discoveries and new research into practices. By creating an environment where everyone feels valued and respected, we can unlock the full potential of our engineers and drive innovation forward. \n\nHere are some of our proofs:\n\n**Demo**\n- Explicit locking in SQL DBMS: [https://bit.ly/3qoELO5](https://bit.ly/3qoELO5)\n- Overview of Hashicorp Vault: [https://bit.ly/3qoEEC9](https://bit.ly/3qoEEC9)\n- Postgres implement multi-version concurrency control: [https://bit.ly/3WG9SB5](https://bit.ly/3WG9SB5)\n\n**Dwarves Brainery**\n- Some light and casual articles on our Brainery: [https://brain.d.foundation/](https://brain.d.foundation/)\n\n**Radio Talk**\n- Software Modeling \u0026 Architecture: [https://youtu.be/6hNXFhz0qow](https://youtu.be/6hNXFhz0qow)\n- Introduction to Driven Domain Design: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZiS-MFXN28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZiS-MFXN28)\n- Database Sharding: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiUWIyigz4U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiUWIyigz4U)\n- State Machine Pattern: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtxSf1QP1wk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtxSf1QP1wk)\n- Database Partition: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoRUFn3UjII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoRUFn3UjII)\n\n**Articles**\n- Design a system for a video streaming platform startup: [https://bit.ly/43yyoWR](https://bit.ly/43yyoWR)\n- zk-SNARKs: [https://bit.ly/43n7jXe](https://bit.ly/43n7jXe)\n- Database Designs for Multilingual Apps: [https://bit.ly/45HNvPw](https://bit.ly/45HNvPw)\n\nFrom every piece of collected knowledge, the group can design robust architectures, develop scalable code, and implement efficient algorithms to build developer-focused products that strengthen the software core. The result is the delivery of software products that meet or exceed client expectations, leading to customer satisfaction, increased revenue, and a competitive edge in the market.\n\nSo far, collaborating between the software design team has led to creative solutions we may not have achieved by working separately. Always keep learning and coding. \n\n---\n**Life at Dwarves** is a series of stories about people, perspectives and lives at the Dwarves Foundation.\n","title":"Software design group: Nurturing architects at Dwarves","short_title":"Software Design Group","description":"At the end of 2021, starting with engineering practices, the core idea behind creating a software design group is to enable engineers to develop the skills required to become software architects.","tags":["life-at-dwarves","software","career"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["innno_"],"date":"Thu Jun 01 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"careers/life/software-design-group.md","slugArray":["careers","life","software-design-group"]},{"content":"\nBeen with us for nearly 5 years, [@thanh](https://memo.d.foundation/contributor/thanh) has been taking care of the juniors and ensuring their progress goes alongside the company’s direction.

Young member needs guidance and advice to orient their path, while seniors need goals to pursue.\n\n### My job is to ensure a healthy environment for everyone to thrive.\n“I guide and train people if they are assigned to me. Dwarves Team has a 60-day Program to evaluate, and it usually is a 90-day plan, but based on the company size, the timeline can be adjusted to optimize its teammate growth.\n\nNewbies can find it struggling to catch up. It happens for everyone - though their abilities are excellent. Hence, newbie tends to do whatever their leader instructs. We have a different approach for Dwarves Team. In this woodland, we encourage people to vision their goals and do what it takes to reach them. The target changes flexibly based on their goals and progress - from weekly check-ups, then monthly, and finally rounds up after 6 months.\n\nIt was quite an experience to mentor. Young member needs guidance and advice to orient their path, while seniors need goals to pursue.”\n\n### Career path is built based on teammate’s expectation.\n“Backed by Team Lead and Engineer Lead, we have 2 tracks for a career path. IC (Individual Contributor) and MT (Management Track). IC is built for teammates who find it challenging to fit in and wish to develop themselves individually. Meanwhile, MT is created for those who want to grow, socialize and work more with people.\n\nAt first, I didn't really enjoy sitting in a manager's seat. My focus was on developing the technical skills only. But in the long run, the Team should have someone to pay attention to, connect every teammate and navigate them based on one direction. So I fit in that slot, expanding the knowledge and encouraging everyone to interact and work well with each other. Time goes by, and here I am - in charging as an Engineer Manager.”\n\n### The key for a stable product quality: Connecting the key roles.\n“There are four key roles to deliver a good project outcome: Product Manager - who provides the answer for the \"What\"; Engineering Lead - who understands the \"How\"; Developer - who manages the deadline and connects all the joint of the codebase, and Engineer Manager - who allocates the right ones for the job. The solid collaboration of these fours forms a stable product quality.\n\nI have conflicts to resolve too, either in the workload of the people. I once met a fresher who wanted to experience with startups. At that time, the company's demand was something different. One thing led to another, and he left. It's one of the problems you bump into once you're sitting at this place - It's to find the balance point between people's expectations and the company's direction.”\n\n### Omw to becoming CTO.\n“What makes this team stand out is their hustle. \n\nI rarely have to worry about the team being lazy. It's like a code of conduct here - People know how to use their time and get things done.\n\nMy future goal is to become a CTO, maybe in around 5-6 years - or sooner if I'm lucky.

I'm glad to help the mates adapt to this working culture because I know how remote working can significantly benefit when you use it wisely. In reverse, the team even reserves support costs for co-working space for the extroverted peeps.\n\nIn short, working from home only minimize our chances of verbal communication.
