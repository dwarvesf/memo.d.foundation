## What is service-based architecture?

Service-based architecture is a kind of hybrid or middle-ground architecture between microservices and a monolith and is noted as a pragmatic architecture style due to its flexibility. Like a microservice architecture, it is essentially a distributed architecture, but it doesn't come with the cost of or complexity of other distributed architectures.

### What are the differences between microservices, service-oriented, and service-based architectures?

> Microservices Architecture and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) are considered service-based architectures

Mark Richards, one of the authors who helped coin the term in the book _Fundamentals of Software Architecture: An Engineering Approach_, notes that service-based architectures lie as a **superset** of microservice and service-oriented architectures. The most notable patterns shared between the architectures, service contracts and a reliance on the [base-model]() with regard to database transactions.

## Why use a service-based architecture?

It is quite arguably a one-size fits a lot of stuff architecture. It is very suitable for projects that contain business requirements a bit too complex to manage (or otherwise accrue technical debt) with a monolith. Likewise, it also doesn't require the level of loose coupling you would typically see in a strict microservice environment.
