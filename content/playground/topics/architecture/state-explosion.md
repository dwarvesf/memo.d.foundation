## What is state explosion?

The main problem that’s stopping widespread usage of state machines is the fact that beyond very simple examples, state machines often end up with numerous states, a lot of them with identical transitions. [statecharts]() solve this _state explosion_ problem.

Similar to [nested positive if statements](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4369822/early-returns-vs-nested-positive-if-statements), state explosions represent combinatorially complex growth of states. This can also be seen with nested [product-types]().

## How do statecharts solve this problem?

### Parallel states

Separating nested finite states into individual states that can be progressed with the same or different events:

### Hierarchical states

Reorganizing nested finite states into a hierarchy, such that the finite state of a child state machine is dependent on the transition between the parent and child machines:

### Guards (conditions)

Guards here serve as a pre-condition to a transition, which essentially prevents a transition from occurring based on a condition:
