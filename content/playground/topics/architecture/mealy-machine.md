## What is a Mealy machine?

A Mealy machine is a [finite-state-automata]() where the output values are determined by its current state and current inputs. It is the closest definition to a deterministic [finite-state-transducer]().

## Mathematical Model

As per the general classification noted on [UC Davis outline on transducers](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/120/spring13/eric-transducers) (formatted with similar variables to [[Finite-state automata]]s), a deterministic Mealy machine has 6 main variables associated with its definition (a sextuple): ($\Sigma$, $S$, $\Gamma$, $\delta$, $\omega$, $s_0$).

- $\Sigma$ is the _input alphabet_ (a finite non-empty set of symbols) -> our events;
- $S$ is a finite non-empty set of states;
- $\Gamma$ is the *output alphabet*;
- $\delta$ is the state-transition function: $\delta: S \times \Sigma \rightarrow S$
- $\omega$ is the output-transition function: $\omega: S \times \Sigma \rightarrow \Gamma$
- $s_0$ is an _initial state_, an element of $S$; and
- $\delta \subseteq S \times (\Sigma \cup \{\epsilon\}) \times (\Gamma \cup \{\epsilon\}) \times S$ (where ε is the [empty string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_string "Empty string")) is the *transition relation*.

Some formulations also allow transition and output functions to be combined as a single function:


$$
\delta: S \times \Sigma \rightarrow S \times \Gamma
$$


Given any initial state in $s_0$, to transition our state to the next state with our output alphabet, our transition would be:


$$
\delta: s_0 \times \Sigma \rightarrow S
$$



$$
\omega: s_0 \times \Sigma \rightarrow \Gamma
$$


## Examples of basic Mealy machines

Our example from [[Finite-state transducer]]s fits perfectly here as our transition and output function are coalesced as a single function.

```typescript
// expiry represents our arbitrary output (in seconds)
type expiry = float;

// expiry here is used in a constructor as an arbitrary output
type trafficLightStatus =
  | Red(expiry)
  | Amber(expiry)
  | Green(expiry)
  | FlashingRed(expiry)

// elapsed here is used in a constructor as an arbitrary input
type input =
  | ExpireTime
  | Error
  | Restart

let transition = (state, input) =>
  switch (state, input) {
  | (Red(expiry), ExpireTime) => Green(60.0)
  | (Red(expiry), Error) => FlashingRed(30.0)
  | (Green(expiry), ExpireTime) => Amber(60.0)
  | (Green(expiry), Error) => FlashingRed(30.0)
  | (Amber(expiry), ExpireTime) => Red(60.0)
  | (Amber(expiry), Error) => FlashingRed(30.0)
  | (FlashingRed(expiry), Restart) => Red(60.0)
  | _ => state
  };
```

## Differences between

### With formal [[Finite-state transducer]]s

Mealy machines are a type of generator and are not used in processing language. As such, they do not have a concept of a final state.

### With [[Moore machine]]s

oth Mealy and Moore machines are generator-type state machines and can be used to parse [regular language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language). The outputs on a Mealy machine depend on **both the state and inputs**, whereas a Moore machine have their outputs **synchronously change with the state.**

> Every Moore machine can be converted to a Mealy machine and every Mealy machine can be converted to a Moore machine. Moore machine and Mealy machine are equivalent.
