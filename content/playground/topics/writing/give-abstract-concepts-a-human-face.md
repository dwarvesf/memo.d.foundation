> In other words, the column put a human cast on a bloodless topic—a central skill for the writer, because people are the prism through which readers love to view the world. (Flaherty 6)

When describing abstract concepts—the economy, markets, and so on—give them a human face. Contextualizing the abstract information in concrete terms, with real, living people and stakes, helps the consumer of the information appreciate the ramifications and impact of the concept much more forcefully than simply conveying facts or ideas. It makes the concept relatable.

But this doesn't mean just conveying an anecdote, or interviewing any person thinking back on their experience; the stakes must be _real_ to that person.
