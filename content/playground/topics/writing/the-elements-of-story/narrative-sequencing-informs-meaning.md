The sequence of information in any story or narrative contributes to the overall meaning of the text. The impact of a fact or an insight can be amplifed or diminished depending on what comes before or after.

People can be strongly persuaded by sequencing. Evidence builds like a crescendo. If you lead with the most amazing fact, the rest will seem dull and boring by comparison. Meanwhile, contrast helps render the contours of an ideaâ€”but so can similarity, when applied judiciously.

But, keep in mind your purpose: if your goal is to inform rather than to persuade, your approach should change accordingly. A newspaper reporter updating a reader on the events of the day shouldn't write a mystery story.
