Writing a "kicker" ending is challenging. A good ending isn't a bare summary or recitation of what the reader has already read; it makes the store memorable. They may serve as a decorative flourish but they can do much more. They might nod toward or acknowledge an element of the story that was knowingly overlooked or under-served, perhaps delivering a needed counterweight. Or, it might add a human element to a story that was otherwise missing one, or suggest that there is more to the story than what's been shared. But don't over do it. Be brief.
