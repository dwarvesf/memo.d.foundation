In his _Story Grid_ approach to writing a novel, Shawn Coyne lists five commandments that he argues are essential to effective fiction. These elements, he says, determine whether or not a scene works:

1.  **Inciting Incident**: An event or disturbance that sets the scene into action
2.  **Progressive Complication / Turning Point**: The action or revelation that forces the POV character to make a decision
3.  **Crisis**: The viewpoint character is forced to make a decision that will result in a bad outcome no matter what they do, or that will benefit them and harm others. This decision is critical to make the character active instead of passive.
4.  **Climax**: The action the character takes as a result of the crisis decision. This results in a (possibly) slight shift in values that provide purpose to the scene.
5.  **Resolution**: The outcome of the climax. The resolution should signify some change; if not, one of the other commandments might be missing.
