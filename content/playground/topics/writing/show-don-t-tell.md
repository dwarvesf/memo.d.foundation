"Show, don't tell" is common advice for writers. It means that you present your audience with information, rather than simply telling them what the information means. For instance, in fiction you might say that a character frowned and snarled, rather than stating that they were angry.

Emotion is better conveyed through a gesture, a nervous tic, than through simply telling the audience that someone was nervous. Common body language is good; individualized signs of emotion are better, advises Francis Flaherty. Quotations, used well, are another example of showing rather than telling.

Showing is generally more vivid than telling; but, this does not mean that there is no place for tell. Telling can be economical and to the point; it's straightforward and brief. It performs grunt work, which sometimes is exactly what's needed. But showing adds the flourish.

## Show, don't tell in business

- [Teresa Torres](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/Teresa+Torres) suggests that sharing information rather than conclusions or recommendations with senior stakeholders is a more effective means to engage them than expecting them to accept your conclusions. Draw a line from your findings toward (but not to) the action you want them to take.

However, [providing perspective is still critical](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/Perspective+is+the+most+important+differentiator).
