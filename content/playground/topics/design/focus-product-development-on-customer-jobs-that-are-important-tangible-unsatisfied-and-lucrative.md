In value proposition design, focus your strongest efforts on customer jobs that fit in the middle of a Venn diagram comprising

- Important: The customer's success or failure at completing the job leads to significant gains or pains
- Tangible: The results of success or failure are experienced immediately or often
- Unsatisfied: The customers' needs are not yet being met by existing value propositions in a satisfying way
- Lucrative: Many people need to complete the job, or a smaller number are willing to pay a premium to complete the job
