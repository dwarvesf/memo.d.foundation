A "job story" is an alternative to the traditional user story format. In contrast to the user story, which foregrounds the persona performing an action, a job story highlights the context in which the action is performed.

For example, where a user story may be written like this:

> As a **working parent**, I want to **order take-out** so I can **spend time with my kids instead of cooking**

A job story might be written like this:

> **When I get home from a long day of work**, I want to **minimize the effort required to get a meal on the table** so I can **spend more time with my kids instead of cooking**

More qualifiers can be added to increase the specificity of the job story, possibly promoting [empathy](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/Different+forms+of+empathy):

> When I get home from a long day of work, and **I’m tired** and **feel pressured** to put food on the table, I want to minimize the effort required to **prepare a healthy meal** so I can spend time with my kids instead of cooking.

Job stories do not offer solutions; they describe the context for which the solution is hired.
