description: Avoid rushing to prototypes in design; focus on deeply understanding the problem first to ensure solutions truly address user needs and avoid wasting effort on the wrong ideas.

In design, it can be tempting to rush to develop a prototype to get "real" feedback on an idea. Erika Hall posits that this is because a prototype, no matter how low fidelity, feels tangible: it provides physical, concrete evidence of progress.

But a prototype assumes you're already answering the right question. If you rush to a prototype, you may end up polishing a concept that won't solve anyone's problem to begin with.

Instead of rushing to a prototype, spend more time in the problem space.
