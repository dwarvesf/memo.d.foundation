> Characteristics of J Types:

- Outwardly firm, direct, and opinionated
- Undeterred from directly expressing their views or wishes (especially EJs); utilize declarative statements
- Tone and mannerisms convey a sense of closure, seriousness, or formalness
- Others may turn to them for answers or decision-making
- See planning as a way of reducing risk and ensuring desirable outcomes
- Experience and express convergence in beliefs / worldview
- More apt to prefer structure and predictability in work settings
- Prefer “traditional” methods of teaching and learning, such as lectures or direct instruction
- Not necessarily neat, tidy, organized, uptight, or punctual
- Less restless and less dependent on a breadth of activities for stimulation (especially IJs)

> Characteristics of P Types:

- Outwardly open, receptive, and adaptable
- Can be reluctant to state things directly (especially IPs); may express themselves in a more tangential fashion (e.g., using hints or questions)
- Are typically unenthusiastic about making detailed plans, especially when involving other people; enjoy the uncertainty of leaving things open-ended
- Slow to reach closure in beliefs or decisions
- Often viewed as good, non-judgmental listeners
- Can be skeptical toward external laws; prefer to make and follow their own rules
- Desire variety, novelty, informality, and minimal structure at work
- Often prefer to teach themselves (especially IPs); teach others by example or facilitation
- Not necessarily messy, disorganized, procrastinating, or chronically late
- Often restless, turning to a breadth of activities for stimulation (especially EPs)
