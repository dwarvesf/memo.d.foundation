Ne feel compelled to explore all the options and possibilities (“the possibilities are endless!”), making it difficult for them to draw conclusions or make decisions.

Ne often present as open-minded, receptive, creative, inquisitive, random, distractible, and playful. They love playing with words, ideas, associations, and quips

> Ne openness can also make NPs uncomfortable around types (typically J types)

### The difference between Ne and Ni

- As an extraverted function, Ne is also more reliant on circulating ideas than Ni is. They seem more concerned with knowing which thinkers and theories are in vogue. They are also notorious for “name dropping,” constantly referencing various books or theorists to support their arguments.

- NPs also rely heavily on contrasts and comparisons

- Ni penetrates deep rather than wide, seeing things in terms of structured hierarchies rather than webs (especially when paired with Te).

- Ne shares information, while Ni gathers information

- Ne knows a little about a lot, while Ni knows a lot about a little

- Ne is good at producing words, while Ni struggles to verbalize thoughts
