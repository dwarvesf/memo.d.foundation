Information is created through the juxtaposition of one idea with another. But insight emerges when that juxtaposition creates a sense of surprise. When we are surprised—when we are confronted not with the expected message but a novel perspective—it expands our understanding by provoking comparison and contrast, evaluation and re-imagination.

For this reason, it is good to read broadly, and to build information systems that include an [ element of randomness](). Luhmann's zettelkasten, Schmidt points out, facilitated the creation of new knowledge by systematically connecting ideas that do not necessarily have an obvious connection to one another.
