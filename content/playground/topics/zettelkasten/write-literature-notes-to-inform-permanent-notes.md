Literature notes are notes that record anything from a text that you might want to use later. They should accurately and faithfully reflect the work you are consuming, but [ translate the ideas into new words]() to help facilitate better understanding.

Be selective when making literature notes: avoid succumbing to the [ collector's fallacy](), which tricks us into thinking because we've captured information that we've mastered it.

Always make literature notes with consideration for what other [ notes you've already taken](), and with an eye toward creating new [ permanent notes]().
