description: Writing is a powerful tool for thinking, as putting ideas into your own words deepens understanding and reveals gaps in logic or contradictions.

Rather than the result of thinking, writing _is_ thinking. Translating the ideas of others into _one's own words_ forces deep consideration of what is being said, and thinking through any contradictions, gaps in logic, or elisions in the text.

Writing further provides a productive feedback loop: to be able write something clearly in our own words, we must be able to understand it.
