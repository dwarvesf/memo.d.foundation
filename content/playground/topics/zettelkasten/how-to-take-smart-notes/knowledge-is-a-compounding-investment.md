description: Learn how building knowledge through connecting ideas boosts creativity and innovation, turning effort into valuable insights with lasting benefits.
---

Knowledge is a long-term investment. Rarely do we get a big score, or a sudden windfall. Insight comes when we connect ideas to one another, processing them into something new. This requires engaging with ideas—thinking about them, writing about them, and connecting them to other pieces of information we've collected. This effort can yield compounding returns: the more quality information we gather—the more connections we can make—the greater value we can yield for our work.

Accruing more knowledge also creates conditions under which serendipity can flourish: the more ideas we have, the more collisions take place between disparate ideas. That can help promote innovation and creativity.
