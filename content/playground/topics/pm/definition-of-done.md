Definition of done also known as **DoD** is a list of criteria which must be met before a product increment (story) is considered "done".

Failure to meet these criteria at the end of a sprint normally implies that the work should not be counted toward that sprint's velocity nor released.

Verifying that our team’s DoD meets these criteria will ensure that we are delivering features that are done both in terms of functionality and quality.

This list will also allow us to reply to this question "Are you done with this feature?" in a non ambiguous way.

## Checklist

**_The following checklist is for the engineers and is meant to evolve overtime._**

- Automated tests are created and pass
- Code is peer-reviewed
- Feature is tested against acceptance criteria
- Feature is ready to be released
