_The following entry is taken from field experience that I'm doing in a team project._

In one Product team, we will receive quite a lot of requirements to do the enhancement for our current system, or will be receiving a request to do a new feature based on the existing system from the product. At this point, there is 1 document that we can rely before working on the requirement - Analysis Documentation.

## What we should do with that document?

- First, we will list out the current behaviors from our current system that is related to the requirement as much as possible. Then, we start to point out the issues/requirements to verify what are the things that the team will need to do.
- After that will be the list of solution to suggest with our client, as this point, from my own experience, I will share this one to Product Managers and Portfolio Leads to have a final alignment.

With this document, there are 2 things that we can be confident with:

- We can finalize again the requirement from our client again before starting to work on the development.
- Every members will have the chance to think and make the plan before developing and testing, to prepare their works as good as possible.
