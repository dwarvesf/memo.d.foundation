According to Roger Martin, perspective on a given issue is formed by the interaction between three things: our **stance**, our **tools**, and our **experience**.

**Stance** describes our personal domain of knowledge as well as our sense of ourselves and our purpose. This frames our personal perspective and approach to the problem space.

**Tools** includes not just physical tools but also the thinking tools we bring to bear on a situation: theories, processes, rules of thumbs, best practices, and so on. We use these to organize complex problem spaces into something more accessible.

**Experience** helps us hone our intuition and informs our sensitivities when regarding a problem or challenge.

These different elements do not flow linearly from one to another; they mutually inform each other.
