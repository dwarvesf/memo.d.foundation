headers.<hr />- Server responds with status 101 Switching Protocols if supported.<hr />- Key components:<hr />  - `Sec-WebSocket-Key`: Random, base64-encoded, prevents caching.<hr />  - `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`: SHA-1 hash of `Sec-WebSocket-Key` + GUID, verifies server support.<hr />- Upgrade process transitions HTTP to WebSocket protocol post handshake.<hr /><hr />**Data Transfer Mechanics**<hr /><hr />- Once connected, exchange `messages`—either text (UTF-8) or binary.<hr />- Uses message `frames`, not streams; each frame is a small header plus payload.<hr />- Frame types:<hr

It provides insights into how Go's concurrency model compares to other languages and offers a deep understanding of Go's efficient approach to managing concurrent tasks.","spr_content":"- Golang's defining feature: built-in concurrency support, via goroutines and channels.  <hr />- Unlike complex concurrency models in other languages, Go makes concurrency simple and lightweight.  <hr />- Go is a concurrent, not explicitly parallel, language; concurrency = \"out of order\" task management, overlapping task execution; parallelism = simultaneous task execution on multiple cores.  <hr />- Concurrency: tasks start, run, complete in overlapping periods; multitasking on a single core; does not guarantee simultaneous execution.  <hr />- Parallelism: tasks run truly at the same time on multicore processors; independent, simultaneous execution.  <hr />- Analogy: concurrency is like stopping a game to run errands (interleaved tasks), parallelism is like playing a game and listening to music at once.  <hr />- Goroutines: lightweight threads managed by Go runtime; start with 2KB stack, dynamically grow/shrink, only 4KB initially, cheaper than OS threads (e.g., Java's 4MB).  <hr />- Goroutine scheduler: built-in, language-level, no OS thread management needed; highly efficient.  <hr />- Channels: communication pipes between goroutines; transmit data of specific type; default unbuffered (blocking send/recv); can use buffered channels with specified capacity to allow non-blocking sends/receives until buffer full/empty.  <hr />- Channel implementation: struct with buffer array, capacity, current count, element size/type, closed state, indices, wait queues, mutex lock, and blocked goroutines (sudog).  <hr />- sudog: struct representing a goroutine waiting on a channel; queues (recvq, sendq) are linked lists of sudogs; manage blocked goroutines for synchronization.  <hr />- When goroutines attempt to read/write on channels before data is available, they are wrapped as sudogs, linked in recvq or sendq, and block until data transfer occurs.  <hr />- The underlying channel buffer: circular queue with fields buf (storage), dataqsize (capacity), qcount (filled slots), elemsize, elemtype, closed flag, sendx/recvx (indices).  <hr />- Go scheduler: manages goroutines across logical processors (P), OS threads (M), and run queues (local LRQ, global GRQ).  <hr />- P: logical processor, assigned to an OS thread (M), maintains local run queue for goroutines.  <hr />- M: OS thread executing goroutines, context-switched on/off P.  <hr />- G: initial goroutine per program; context-switched on/off M.  <hr />- Scheduling components: GRQ (global queue), LRQ (local queue), all stored in user space; cooperative scheduler with preemptive features.  <hr />- Triggering factors for scheduler: use of `go` keyword, garbage collection, system calls.  <hr />- Hardware context: hyper-threaded cores (Virtual cores), each assigned to an M, enabling efficient goroutine execution.  <hr />- Goroutine-to-M mapping: goroutines are scheduled onto M within P’s LRQ; M manages execution context, goroutine switching, low latency.  <hr />- Overall: Go's concurrency model abstracts thread management, using lightweight goroutines and channels, orchestrated by a sophisticated runtime scheduler for efficient, scalable concurrent programming.","tags":"concurrency golang","authors":"hieuthu1","date":{"days":18234},"category":"playground > topics > golang"},"383":{"file_path":"playground/topics/golang/use-go-selenium-to-crawl-data.md","title":"Use Go Selenium To Crawl Data","description":"Learn how to use Go with Selenium to crawl dynamic web pages, overcoming challenges like AJAX-loaded content and login requirements.

high liquidity markets feature continuous buying and selling, low liquidity markets are fragmented.  <hr />- Visual patterns of liquidity markets include real-time trading flows, order books, and transaction lines.  <hr />- Market structure can be recognized through order flow, bid-ask spread, and transaction depth; visualized via trading graphs and order books.  <hr />- Market forms encompass spot market, derivatives, and decentralized exchanges, each with distinct liquidity characteristics.  <hr />- Liquidity pools enhance asset tradeability, facilitating quick buy-sell transactions, akin to instant market clearance.  <hr />- Liquidity markets are characterized by a high volume of buy and sell orders, with frequent price updates and bid-ask spreads.  <hr />- Liquidity can be visualized through order books, showing distributed buy and sell orders, indicating market depth.  <hr />- Trading interfaces display different visualizations but underpin similar fundamental mechanics—buy/sell, order flow, and asset liquidity.  <hr />- Visual layouts differ; some markets emphasize order book density, others focus on recent trades or price charts, but core principle remains the same.  <hr />- Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and traditional markets both depend on liquidity, which is essential for trading efficiency.  <hr />- The liquidity market’s shape influences strategy: market-making, asset listing, and trading behavior patterns.  <hr />- Market behavior shows a mix of buy and sell orders fluctuating over time, reflecting market sentiment and liquidity conditions.  <hr />- Visual cues (e.g., order flow lines, color-coded bids/asks) help identify liquidity and trading activity levels.  <hr />- Understanding liquidity forms aids in designing better financial products, trading strategies, and risk management tools.  <hr />- Recognizing market shape informs operational and strategic decisions, such as market entry, exit, or asset liquidity enhancement.  <hr />- Visual patterns include consistent order flow, bid-ask spread, transaction volume, and price movements.  <hr />- Market structures share common features despite different display styles;

Gen_server suffices for simple states; gen_statem for insert event, trigger actions, stage persistence (e.g., TCP-Redis). Emphasized structuring states, data, and transitions to improve maintainability and understandability. Analogous to managing complex WebSocket state with many stages, using dedicated managers and clear structure. Highlights Erlang’s built-in support for state machines, fostering uniform mental models, better code clarity, avoid implicit bugs. In Elixir, must call Erlang natively; no native lib equates to Erlang’s built-in, making team’s mental model unified. Demonstrated a TCP-Redis connection module with two stages: disconnected and connected. Connection attempts, retries, request handling modeled explicitly with state transitions, hooks, timeouts. Critical points include defining callback modes, handling events, transitioning states with `next_stage`, and leveraging `handle_event`. The approach contrasts with a gen_server using an explicit state machine, offering structured control flow, especially for long-lived, persistent connections. Use cases: TCP, TCP-Redis, persistent protocols, exact control over transition actions, timing, robustness.
