common in low-level languages like C.<hr />  - Function returns success (e.g., `0`) or failure (e.g., `-1`).<hr />  - Caller responsible for checking return value; missing checks can lead to silent bugs.<hr /><hr />- **Exceptions (Try-Catch)**: <hr />  - Modern structured error handling; used in languages like Python, Java, C#.<hr />  - Program throws exceptions, caught in `try-catch` blocks.<hr />  - Ensures separation of normal logic and error handling; use specific exceptions, avoid swallowing them.<hr /><hr />- **Error Objects or Results**: <hr />  - Forces return of an object indicating success or error.<hr />  - Common in functional languages like Rust and Swift.<hr />  - Promotes explicit handling of success and errors, reducing missed error handling.<hr /><hr />- **Assertions**: <hr />  - Debugging tool to enforce conditions; program crashes if assertion fails.<hr />  - Not for production error handling; suited for development.<hr /><hr />- **Callbacks (Error-First)**: <hr />  - Common in asynchronous environments like Node.js.<hr />  - First parameter is error; check error first in callbacks.<hr />  - Can lead to \"callback hell\" with nested operations.<hr /><hr />- **Promise-Based Error Handling**: <hr />  - Evolved from callbacks; cleaner asynchronous code handling.<hr />  - Uses `.then()` for success, `.catch()` for errors.<hr />  - Improves readability, but can complicate debugging with misplaced `.catch()`.<hr /><hr />- **Pattern Matching**: <hr />  - Utilized in functional languages to handle computation outcomes.<hr />  - Decomposes data structures; requires handling all possible cases.<hr /><hr />- **Panic (Crash)**: <hr />  - Used for non-recoverable errors in languages like Rust and Go.<hr />  - Results in program crash; reserved for critical scenarios, not user input errors.","tags":"error go","authors":"tieubao","date":"Mon Oct 14 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","category":"playground > 00_fleeting"},"129":{"file_path":"playground/00_fleeting/202302281019-case-study-write-heavy-scalable-and-reliable-inventory-platform.md","title":"Case study: Write-heavy scalable and reliable inventory platform","description":"How Doordash designed a successful write-heavy scalable and reliable inventory platform","spr_content":"- **Case Study:** Development of a write-heavy, scalable, and reliable inventory platform.  <hr />- **Technical Requirements:** <hr />  - High scalability. <hr />  - High reliability. <hr />  - Low latency. <hr />  - High observability.  <hr />- **Database Table Optimization Strategies:**  <hr />  - Natural primary key creation from business parameters to enhance query efficiency.  <hr />  - Clean up database indexes: <hr />    - Add missing indexes for all queries.  <hr />    - Remove unnecessary indexes.  <hr />  - Reduce column count by consolidating frequently updated columns into a single JSONB column;

**Disadvantages**: Slow initial load, SEO challenges, large bundles affect performance.<hr />  - **React Example**: Data fetching on the client side with hooks.<hr /><hr />- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**:<hr />  -

**Disadvantages**: Increased server load, setup complexity, hydration delays.<hr />  - **Next.js Example**: Uses `getServerSideProps` for server-rendered pages.<hr /><hr />- **Static-site Generation (SSG)**:<hr />  -
