Defined in square brackets `[]`, allowing functions/types to accept multiple types.<hr />   - Example: `func Print[T any](items []T) { ... }` where `T` is the type parameter and `any` is a default constraint.<hr /><hr />2. **Type Constraints**: <hr />   - Limit types that type parameters can represent, maintaining type safety.<hr />   - Interfaces or built-in constraints (e.g., `comparable`, `any`).<hr />   - Example: Custom interface `Stringer` ensuring compliance with specific method implementation.<hr /><hr />3. **Compile-Time Checking**: <hr />   - Go checks types at compile time to ensure compliance with constraints.<hr />   - Prevents compilation of programs with incorrect type usages.<hr /><hr />4. **Underlying Type Consistency**: <hr />   -

Default in React; minimal HTML, JavaScript bundle handles rendering.<hr />  - **How it Works**: Browser downloads JS, builds UI, fetches data post-load.<hr />  - **Advantages**: Fast deployment, rich interactivity, simplified development.<hr />  - **Disadvantages**: Slow initial load, SEO challenges, large bundles affect performance.<hr />  - **React Example**: Data fetching on the client side with hooks.<hr /><hr />- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**:<hr />  - Generates complete HTML on server for each request; React hydrates for interactivity.<hr />  - **How it Works**: Server returns fully-rendered HTML; hydration occurs in the client.<hr />  - **Advantages**: Better SEO, faster time to interactive, accessible content on slower networks.<hr />  - **Disadvantages**: Increased server load, setup complexity, hydration delays.<hr />  - **Next.js Example**: Uses `getServerSideProps` for server-rendered pages.<hr /><hr />- **Static-site Generation (SSG)**:<hr />  - Pre-renders HTML at build time; serves static files.<hr />  - **How it Works**: Static HTML files generated once per build; served directly.<hr />  - **Advantages**: Fast performance, SEO-friendly, low server load.<hr />  - **Disadvantages**: Less flexibility, not suitable for dynamic content, potential long build times.<hr />  - **Next.js Example**: Uses `getStaticProps` for static page generation.<hr /><hr />- **Comparison of CSR, SSR, SSG**:<hr />  - **Data Fetching**: CSR (client-side), SSR (server-side per request), SSG (at build time).<hr />  - **Rendering**: CSR (browser), SSR (server then browser), SSG (server at build).<hr />  - **Best for**: CSR (interactive apps), SSR (SEO-sensitive, dynamic), SSG (static content).<hr />  - **SEO**: CSR (limited), SSR/SSG (strong).<hr />  - **Initial Load Time**: CSR (depends on bundle), SSR (faster), SSG (fastest).<hr />  - **Content Freshness**: CSR (real-time), SSR (real-time), SSG (stale until rebuild).<hr />  - **Hosting Cost**: CSR/SSG (lower), SSR (higher).<hr /><hr />- **Choosing Strategy**: <hr />  - CSR: SPAs, interactivity; <hr />  - SSR: SEO and dynamic content; <hr />  - SSG: Static sites, infrequent updates.<hr /><hr />- **Hybrid Approach**:<hr />  -
