Prospect**: Analyze stakeholders, business models, goals, and challenges; ensure alignment on design elements like mindset, style, color palette, typography, iconography, illustration, and photography.<hr />  <hr />- **Defining Product Elements**:<hr />  - **Style**: Establish layout style aligned with target users; reference platforms like Dribbble and Behance for trends.<hr />  - **Color**: Define primary and secondary colors; utilize apps like Milanote for moodboarding; apply the 6:3:1 rule and limit to 3 primary colors for visual harmony.<hr />  - **Typography**: Specify typeface and styles (header, subheader, body) including font-size and weight.<hr />  - **Iconography**: Create icons reflective of branding; select icon colors from established color palette.<hr />  - **Illustrations and Images**: Apply visual elements consistent with content and style; use bitmap masks for file exports.<hr />  - **Platform Consideration**: Detail specific screens (desktop, mobile, tablet) and implement grid layouts to optimize designs.<hr />  - **Responsive Design**: Ensure adaptability across devices; consider user requirements for responsiveness.<hr /><hr />- **Demo Design**: Produce preliminary screens for client review; if color palette is undecided, start with grayscale focus to emphasize layout, text, and spacing.<hr /><hr />- **Design System**:<hr />  - **Definition**: A design system is a collection of reusable components guided by standards, fostering scalability and product development speed.<hr />  - **Building Steps**:<hr />    - Align teams on

It also demonstrates how to render a chart for this strategy using Matplotlib and Seaborn","spr_content":"- Cryptocurrency markets grow in tandem with blockchain technology, attracting investors and traders.  <hr />- Strategies depend on analyzing market indicators, notably BTC-Altcoins outperform metric.  <hr />- \"Hedge\" is a risk management strategy involving offsetting positions across assets.  <hr />- Financial instruments split into cash instruments (ownership-based, e.g., stocks, bonds) and derivatives (performance-based, e.g., options).  <hr />- Cash instruments retain inherent value; derivatives depend on underlying assets' performance, with risk of total loss if assets decline.  <hr />- Hedging involves balancing primary assets with negatively correlated assets to mitigate losses.  <hr />- Example: Bitcoin investor hedges by diversifying into altcoins, which often move inversely to BTC.  <hr />- Price volatility stems from Bitcoin’s market dominance and fluctuating fund flows between BTC and altcoins.  <hr />- BTC dominance measures Bitcoin’s market share; it influences altcoin performance and market dynamics.  <hr />- Market scenarios: funds flow (BTC→Altcoins, Altcoins→BTC), entry (BTC-focused, Altcoin-focused), exit (BTC withdrawal, Altcoin withdrawal).  <hr />- Hedging reduces risk but constrains profit; simultaneous drops in assets challenge effectiveness.  <hr />- Performance metrics, especially Bitcoin vs. Altcoin outperformance, guide hedge refinement amid volatility.  <hr />- BTC-Altcoin outperformance combines two metrics: BTC performance (BTCp) and Altcoins performance (ALTp), each as percent change from historic mean.  <hr />- Positive BTCp indicates BTC overperforming; negative indicates underperformance.  <hr />- Similarly for ALTp with altcoins.  <hr />- Outperformance formula: (BTC profit / BTC initial) – (Altcoin profit / Altcoin initial).  <hr />- Relative strength assessment informs hedging adjustments: positive suggests shifting to Bitcoin; negative suggests favoring altcoins.  <hr />- To visualize, create a trading platform account supporting derivatives on BTC and altcoins.  <hr />- Open and monitor long/short positions on Bitcoin and a diversified set of altcoins.  <hr />- Record profit/loss periodically; compute percentage gains/losses relative to initial positions.  <hr />- Calculate outperformance over the interval; plot on a line chart over time for trend analysis.  <hr />- Tracking this metric helps traders, developers, and data analysts recognize market shifts and optimize strategies.","tags":"blockchain data fintech","authors":"bievh","date":{"days":20090},"category":"updates > build-log"},"262":{"file_path":"updates/build-log/centralized-monitoring-setup-for-trading-platform.md","title":"Setup centralized monitoring system for Hedge Foundation trading platform","description":"A technical case study for implementing centralized monitoring for a trading platform using Grafana and Prometheus, focusing on real-time alerts, data integrity, and resource optimization to prevent financial losses.","spr_content":"- Hedge Foundation is a private trading platform with a select user base and high-stakes trading.<hr />- Platform failure or data loss risks substantial financial and reputational damage.<hr />- Reputational risk is heightened by small user base;

it is essential for a cohesive and visually appealing design.<hr />- Layout can be categorized into two types: Grid layout and Free-form layout.<hr />- Grid layout relies on a network of lines (horizontal, vertical, angled, or circular) to organize content hierarchically and guide consistency.<hr />- Grid types in web and app design include rows, columns, and combined grid systems, typically with 12, 8, or 4 columns based on device (desktop, tablet, mobile).<hr />- Field elements (text, images) are blocks that sit within columns; background colors are not considered field elements unless containers.<hr />- Columns are thick blocks defining content width; default widths are 60–80px, chosen for consistency and readability.<hr />- Gutters are spacing (typically 20px) between columns, critical for masonry or card grid designs, maintaining clarity and separation.<hr />- Side margins (20–30px) on mobile limit minimum whitespace; margins change across breakpoints.<hr />- Use grid rules diligently: field elements must occupy specific columns, avoiding spilling into gutters or outside columns.<hr />- Nesting elements within non-grid-aligned containers is acceptable if the parent container aligns with grid columns.<hr />- Do not use columns as outside padding unless intentional; extra indentation reduces effective content space.<hr />- In responsive design, grid adapts by varying the number of columns; column widths and gutters may stay fixed or fluid.<hr />- Fixed grids maintain same column sizes; content may overflow or have large margins on breakpoints, causing layout breaks.<hr />- Fluid grids adjust dynamically to window size, wrapping or resizing elements without breaking layout until the next breakpoint.<hr />- Applying rigorous grid principles results in cleaner, more professional designs; omitting layout steps leads to inconsistent, less appealing outcomes.<hr />- Building a solid layout foundation is key to achieving beauty and accuracy in visual design outputs.","tags":"design technique","authors":"","date":{"days":18491},"category":"playground > topics > design"},"408":{"file_path":"playground/topics/design/what-i-learned-on-design-thinking-and-software-development.md","title":"What I Learned On Design Thinking And Software Development","description":"Learn how design thinking and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) guide software projects to create user-focused products efficiently with quality, budget, and time management.","spr_content":"- Design thinking is an iterative process focused on understanding user needs and problems.<hr />- It involves defining problems to identify optimal solutions, prototyping ideas, and testing.<hr />- The five phases of design thinking are: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test.<hr />- Empathize involves understanding the audience.<hr />- Define requires articulating user problems, needs, and insights.<hr />- Ideate encourages generating many ideas, then synthesizing the best for innovative solutions.<hr />- Prototype is creating tangible solutions.<hr />- Test evaluates solutions and gathers feedback.<hr />- Design thinking originated in fields beyond software, like branding, events, and art.<hr />- The product development process across fields aims for success—quality, relevance, and impact.<hr />- Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) formalizes software creation, balancing quality, cost, and time.<hr />- SDLC phases: Requirement analysis, Planning, System design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance.<hr />- Requirement analysis and planning are crucial for understanding project goals, purpose, risks, and constraints.<hr />- Planning manages three constraints: quality, budget, and time.<hr />- Waterfall SDLC model proceeds linearly, with each stage completed before the next;

retraining often relies on extensive prompts and overhauls.  <hr />- Fine-tuning adjusts weights via supervised learning on curated datasets, embedding domain-specific info directly into the model’s parameters.  <hr />- Retraining involves comprehensive reprocessing, often costly, unadapted to small updates, and token-expensive during inference.  <hr />- Fine-tuning is more token-efficient at inference time, avoids large prompts, better for long conversations.  <hr />- Fine-tuning workflow: start with a base model → prepare domain-specific dataset → clean data → fine-tune via supervised learning → evaluate, feedback, possibly iterate with reinforcement learning.  <hr />- Risks include catastrophic forgetting: loss of old knowledge when updating weights, mitigated by techniques like PEFT (e.g., LoRA) that freeze or selectively update parts of the model.  <hr />- Fine-tuning enhances model specificity for targeted topics, e.g., medical notes, capturing jargon, abbreviations, handwriting nuances for high accuracy.  <hr />- Retraining with prompts can be broad but less precise on niche terms; token cost escalates with prompt size, conversation length, and context.  <hr />- Fine-tuned models are pre-knowledge integrated; retraining retains only a versioned prompt or memory stack.  <hr />- Fine-tuning involves datasets (~4800 tokens specific to the task), cost estimation, job submission, status monitoring, validation.  <hr />- External fine-tuning services (OpenAI API, hosted models) are accessible; local fine-tuning requires hardware and infrastructure.  <hr />- Iterative loops with human feedback (reward modeling, reinforcement learning) optimize model performance over time.  <hr />- Fine-tuning is preferable for specific, deep knowledge areas; retraining suits frequent data updates and broad generalization.  <hr />- Use case example: doctors’ notes with technical shorthand: fine-tuning captures nuanced language, retraining may struggle with accuracy.  <hr />- Fine-tuning upgrades the model’s core, enabling in-model knowledge retrieval; retraining may require large prompts or external tools, consuming tokens.  <hr />- Fine-tuning is suitable when domain-specific precision outweighs resource costs; retraining is better for ongoing data refresh with less specialization.  <hr />- Data archiving and backup differ: archiving stores raw, semi-structured, unstructured data long-term for compliance and recovery; backup is for system restore and hotfixing.  <hr />- Archiving system architecture: store data with metadata in cloud storage; process via vectorization, checksum, metadata indexing for quick retrieval.  <hr />- Archiving benefits: reduce query load, protect data integrity, enable parallel access, manage large datasets efficiently.  <hr />- Storage tiers: hot for recent, active data; cold for outdated, infrequently accessed data; automated tiering reduces costs.  <hr />- Technologies: TimescaleDB’s chunk movement, Azure’s tiered storage, Backblaze, and custom compression techniques; platforms offer trade-offs in speed, cost, complexity.  <hr />- Data growth management strategies: exclude unused older data, compress, partition, or offload to cheaper storage layers to optimize query performance.  <hr />- Practical data architecture: raw data ingestion (ELT), transformation, structured storage, data science sandbox, supporting BI and ML with optimized query layers.  <hr />- Cross-system replication vs. data sharding: replication duplicates databases for load balancing; sharding splits data into manageable parts, enabling scalable analysis.  <hr />- Data integration pipelines: capture change data (CDC), stream via Kafka, store in S3/Hudi, process for analytics.  <hr />- Data governance: monitor data integrity with checksums, policy-based scheduling, automated workflows, resource management across cloud providers.  <hr />- Data lifecycle management aligns with business needs: long-term storage, cost control, rapid access for recent data, and controlled aging of cold data.","tags":"discord office-hours ogif","authors":"innno_","date":{"days":20086},"category":"updates > OGIF"},"741":{"file_path":"updates/OGIF/39-20250207.md","title":"OGIF Office Hours #39 - Frontend updates, Database scaling, AI workflow, and Macro insights","description":"In OGIF 39, the team explored React 19 and Deno Deploy updates, database scaling with CI and migrations, Tom’s AI-driven dev workflow, and macro insights on protectionism and globalization trends.","spr_content":"- LLMs embed extensive knowledge, abilities, and concepts within their latent space.  <hr />- Priming specific word sequences activates latent capabilities, akin to associative cues in human cognition.  <hr />- Effective prompts serve as shorthand to evoke complex internal states that generate relevant responses.  <hr />- SPR involves distilling complex contexts into succinct associative cues to prime models purposefully.  <hr />- This approach leverages deep neural network embeddings to enhance NLP, NLU, and NLG tasks.  <hr />- Priming with targeted language activates conceptual and procedural latent abilities in models.  <hr />- SPR strategies include concise assertions, metaphors, analogies, and assertions to embody key content.  <hr />- Latent space functions as a multidimensional conceptual map, accessible through strategic linguistic cues.  <hr />- For collaboration and knowledge sharing, SPR encapsulates critical topics as minimal, potent prompts.  <hr />- In code and system design contexts, SPR aligns model activation with specific technological and process knowledge.  <hr />- The structure of SPR supports rapid concept activation, reasoning, and planning within advanced NLP workflows.","tags":"discord office-hours ogif","authors":"innno_","date":{"days":20131},"category":"updates > OGIF"},"742":{"file_path":"updates/OGIF/27-20241011.md","title":"OGIF Office Hours #27 - Go Weekly, Frontend Report Sep, UX Guide to Prompt with AI, Computing the Union of Two Finite Automata","description":"In OGIF office hour 27, covering presentations on UX Guide to Prompt with AI, computing the union of finite automata, and other topics including Go Weekly and Frontend Report for September.","spr_content":"- Human-AI interaction trends emphasize UX beyond speed and accuracy.<hr />- \"Race\" framework (Role, Action, Context, Expectation) structures effective prompts.<hr />- Enhancing AI UX involves rephrasing for context, implicit references, conversation continuity.<hr />- AI scoring and system prompting tailor outputs to context and goals.<hr />- UX design should focus on interaction quality, not just prompt efficiency.<hr />- \"Race\" assists designers in defining roles, actions, contextual cues, and expectations.<hr />- System prompting guides AI behavior for specific task directions, differing from research-centric prompts.<hr />- Prompts for builders involve integrating \"Race\" into app architecture, combining factors for reliable outputs.<hr />- Finite automata summarize state transitions, used in input validation like regex (emails, phone numbers).<hr />- Finite automata types: DFA (single transition per state) and NFA (multiple/no transitions).<hr />- Union automata merge states/transitions of two automata, representing combined validation logic.<hr />- Practical union uses state pruning, checking only reachable states relevant to input matching.<hr />- Automata states correspond to real-world conditions;
