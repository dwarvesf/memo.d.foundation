We introduce the C4 model, a powerful framework that simplifies these challenges by using layered abstractions and visualizations. Explore how the model breaks down software architecture into comprehensible levels—Context, Container, Component, and Code—and offers guidelines on creating effective diagrams. Real-world examples illustrate the application of the C4 model, making it an invaluable tool for creating a shared understanding and ensuring clear, meaningful communication among all parties involved.","tags":"software-design software-architecture graphical-notation","authors":"jim","date":"Thu May 23 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","category":"playground > 01_literature"},"238":{"file_path":"playground/01_literature/how-we-crafted-the-ogif-summarizer-bot-to-streamline-weekly-knowledge-sharing.md","title":"How we crafted the OGIF summarizer bot to streamline weekly knowledge-sharing","description":"Introducing the OGIF Memo Summarizer, a chatbot we developed using Dify in collaboration with @innno_.

Real-world examples illustrate the application of the C4 model, making it an invaluable tool for creating a shared understanding and ensuring clear, meaningful communication among all parties involved.","tags":["software-design","software-architecture","graphical-notation"],"authors":["jim"],"date":"Thu May 23 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","category":"playground > 01_literature"},{"id":"585","file_path":"playground/01_literature/how-we-crafted-the-ogif-summarizer-bot-to-streamline-weekly-knowledge-sharing.md","title":"How we crafted the OGIF summarizer bot to streamline weekly knowledge-sharing","description":"Introducing the OGIF Memo Summarizer, a chatbot we developed using Dify in collaboration with @innno_.
