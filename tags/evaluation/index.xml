This guide outlines a clear, step-by-step approach to effectively evaluating and optimizing the integration of a third-party Large Language Model (LLM) into your application.</description></item><item><title>Evaluating search engine in RAG systems</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/01_literature/hybrid-search/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/01_literature/hybrid-search/</guid><description>Introduction Retrieval-Augmented Generation is challenging the world of traditional search engines and LLM information retrieval. Hybrid search, which combines the strengths of vector search and full-text search, offers a powerful solution for the lack of precision in vector search and meaning in full-text search.</description></item></channel></rss>
