It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like finding your way down a mountain in the fog: you take small steps in the direction that seems to be going downhill the fastest.</description></item><item><title>A Grand Unified Theory of the AI Hype Cycle</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ai/a-grand-unified-theory-of-the-ai-hype-cycle/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ai/a-grand-unified-theory-of-the-ai-hype-cycle/</guid><description>The Cycle The history of AI goes in cycles, each of which looks at least a little bit like this:</description></item><item><title>Exploring Machine Learning Approaches For Fine Tuning Llama Models</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/01_literature/exploring-machine-learning-approaches-for-fine-tuning-llama-models/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/01_literature/exploring-machine-learning-approaches-for-fine-tuning-llama-models/</guid><description>At Dwarves, we&amp;rsquo;ve been increasingly exposed to more state-of-the-art news coming from AI than ever before, of course, related to Large Language Models (LLM).</description></item></channel></rss>
