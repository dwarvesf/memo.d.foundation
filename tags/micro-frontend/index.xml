An architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole
Benefits Smaller, more cohesive, and maintainable codebases More scalable organizations with decoupled, autonomous teams The ability to upgrade, update, or even rewrite parts of the frontend in a more incremental fashion than was previously possible Easier maintenance: Keeping frontend repositories small and specialized allows them to be more easily understood, and this simplifies long-term maintenance and testing.</description></item></channel></rss>
