Meeting Etiquette Meetings start on time
If you&amp;rsquo;re leading a meeting, it&amp;rsquo;s your responsibility to start the meeting on time. If you&amp;rsquo;re attending a meeting, you are responsible for showing up on time.
Meetings happen in regular hours
All team members should make themselves available for face-to-face meetings between 10:30am - 1:00p, as long as they are scheduled at least 24 hours in advance.</description></item></channel></rss>
