What is Learning at Dwarves?\n\u003e At Dwarves Foundation, we believe that learning is one of the most important aspects of any organization. We also believe in creating a culture that fosters learning and innovation.\n\nWe want to demonstrate and encourage individual and organizational learning, where both gaining and sharing knowledge is prioritized, valued, and rewarded. Learning is an ongoing process that never ends in our fast-moving industry. The concept of continued learning at Dwarves Foundation has become synonymous with having a growth mindset — a belief in your own ability to change or grow through experience or study.\n\nTo grow as professionals, so we have built an environment where people feel comfortable asking questions and admitting they don't know everything. We encourage people to seek out opportunities outside their normal day-to-day work, whether that means attending conferences or taking on new projects with other departments within the company.\n\nNot only that, but we also believe that every employee has something to teach others, whether it is through formal instruction or simply by helping others with their work. We are committed to providing the tools, education, and training needed for all employees to be successful in their roles. In addition, we organize many events and activities for our people to express their ideas, share their knowledge, and learn with others:\n\n1. **Monday's radio talk**: a weekly show where people can share their thoughts on a given topic and hear what others have to say as well.\n1. **Friday's showcase**: a weekly presentation where people can share what they've been working on lately with the rest of the company.\n1. **Brainery**: a collection of learning pieces where we want to build up the 1% improvement habit of learning in public.\n1. **R\u0026D Topics**: our hub for research and development to tackle common challenges and an environment to foster continuous improvement and learning.\n1. **Dwarves Rewind**: a curated list of trending and starred topics from our Discord and news list reviewing industry changes over every week.\n\n## Brainery\n### Inception and Growth\nWe’ve refreshed and reorganized our Brainery since the start of August 2021 in an effort to involve our company and community members in sharing knowledge.\n\nWe were surprised to see that our knowledge graph has grown into something substantial, and we’re excited to see what everyone will be learning in 2023.\n\n![brainery](assets/2022-forward-engineering_brainery-graph_compressed.mp4)\n\n### Trending Tags\nA summary of some trending tags we see in our Brainery. These tags represent what things our contributors are actively thinking about and researching.\n\nOur company, as well as the industry, is very frontend heavy, so it’s refreshing to see that frontend still has a strong place in our learning endeavors. We’ve been able to hear voices from our backend engineers, our data team, and definitely our community members.\n\n![](assets/2022-forward-engineering_forward-engineering-year-2022_fdc3f02efffae1ad50e061ba23e81362_md5.webp)\n\n### Newest Contributors\nWe collect a list of new contributors, those who have contributed knowledge for the first time in our Brainery.

As an innovative software firm, we found that the foundations surrounding innovative software were also vital to realizing their prospects.\n\nBelow are some of the common problems we’ve begun more critical research and exploration on:\n\n### Common problems\n* ***Locate on Web and Mobile:*** Have you considered making your application available in various languages, currencies, timezones, etc., to users across the globe? You can boost revenue with this method. With the help of the following research, development, and other efforts, we are currently attempting to present this engine to you as the Common Challenge solution.\n* ***Query Database 500M Records, Filter Multiple Table:*** If a day, our database contained 500 million records and despite our customers having to wait five minutes, they were still unable to complete a transaction. How would you approach this difficulty if you were a business owner? We are here to help you find a solution.\n* ***Database Connection Concurrency:*** As a Software Engineer, I'm sure you're aware that when working at the Backend level, we must manage any transactions that occur between our services and the database. Sure, have you considered how we can implement it effectively if you need to interact with more than one entity at the same time?\n\n![](assets/2022-forward-engineering_forward-engineering-year-2022_5c73807e107d674db4880be752f44319_md5.webp)\n\nThis year, we’ve completed one of our challenges, **Feature Flags**. This was a concern spanning across our DevOps, Management, and Engineering domains. We’re proud to list it as one of our completed challenges:\n\n### Completed challenges\n**Feature flags:** Options to enable/disable a feature in the application to help developers have a good experience and improve performance in the development process. We have discovered 3 solutions to resolve this challenge. With a wide range of solutions, we have the ability to serve any usage and project in development life.\n* **Solutions and articles:**\n* [https://viblo.asia/p/feature-toggle-BQyJK33QJMe#_introduction-0](https://viblo.asia/p/feature-toggle-BQyJK33QJMe#_introduction-0)\n* [https://dwarvesf.hashnode.dev/common-challenges-feature-flag](https://dwarvesf.hashnode.dev/common-challenges-feature-flag)\n* [https://medium.com/dwarves-foundation/design-a-feature-flag-system-7986b4a080cc](https://medium.com/dwarves-foundation/design-a-feature-flag-system-7986b4a080cc)\n\n### Newest challenges\nHere are some of the new topics we’ve added this year that we believe will be pressing challenges we will face very soon:\n\n1. Design an On-Ramp and Off-ramp p2p system for cryptocurrency\n1. Design system for layer 2 using ZK rollup\n1. Design system for indexing data on-chain\n1. Design multisign wallet support for all blockchain\n\n### Keywords for upcoming challenges\nHere are some of the keywords we’re on the watch for where we haven’t specified a problem statement but we expect will manifest challenges in the near future.\n\n* zkEVM/zkVM\n* Rollups\n* Staking\n* Ethereum Adoption\n\n## Research Narratives\n### Software Design Research Group\nWe’ve held our Software Design research group for just over a year. Many changes have happened, with Hoang Nguyen, our backend engineer, leading the group. We’ve had quite a lot of topics, some are, but not limited to:\n\n* **Database Normalization** by Minh Luu. An inside look at normalization strategies in databases.\n* **Event-sourcing** by Cuong Mai. A simplified but enterprise outlook on managing persistence.\n* **Database Partitioning Design** by Hoang Nguyen. A look at vertical scalable practices for PostgreSQL.\n* **Sharding Design** by Hieu Vu. A look at horizontally scalable practices for PostgreSQL through a demo on Citus.\n* **HyperLogLog** by [Huy | Maius Pay#8518]. An algorithmic solution to a count-distinct problem.\n\n### Closing December 2022\nRight before New Year, we were able to finish off the year with some exciting topics:\n* **CQRS MODELING**: We've just had an inside look at CQRS modeling and application refactoring presented by Cuong, one of our backend engineers. Domain Driven Design, Event Sourcing, and now CQRS were research topics undertaken by Cuong to understand enterprise-level design patterns better.\n\n* **DOCUMENT DATABASE**: We've also got to see a demo from Khang, our backend engineer, demoing CRUD, indexing, aggregation and other features from a distributed instance of MongoDB for his research on document databases. Khang has gone into great detail of the inner workings of MongoDB and the nuances of a document database.\n\n## Dwarves Rewind 2022\n[Dwarves Rewind](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/dwarves-rewind-6963734647327375360/) is a reading list serving as a collection of news we aggregate weekly. Tech is a very high-paced industry, and rewind helps to serve as a curated list of trending and high-profile topics that everyone can look back on.\n\n![](assets/2022-forward-engineering_forward-engineering-year-2022_ae9016b58831984c03b5125922855553_md5.webp)\n\n### Trending Topics\nSome of our trending topics over the year caught our eye as we see the industry progress.\n\n- **August:** Aptos and Sui Blockchain Platform\n- **September:** Grafana Tokio Console Data Source\n- **October:** Announcing TypeScript 4.9 Beta, Meta got bumped off world's top 20 companies' list, Tesla’s AI Day, Binance Becomes Second-largest Entity Of Uniswap\n- **November:** Kobecon + CloudNativeCon 2022, .NET 7 release, Meta's New AI System 'Galactica\n- **December:** Warner Music Group Joins Forces With Polygon, Starbucks Launched Web3 'Odyssey', Gate.io pledges $100M to revive the crypto industry.\n\n### Hottest Topics\nThe hottest topics that shook the tech industry, from captivating and controversial products to groundbreaking AI, emerged from state-of-the-art tech.\n\n- **August:** Stable Diffusion release, DALL-E release, Github Copilot release\n- **September:** Apple Event - Far Out, Ethereum Mainnet Merge, iOS16, Adobe to buy Figma in $20 billion bid\n- **October:** Next.js Conf 2022, Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk, macOS Ventura 13.0 release, Vercel announces Turbopack, Mass layoffs at Twitter and giant tech firms, Made by Google 2022: Google Pixel 7 \u0026 7 Pros, Aptos Mainnet “Aptos Autumn.”\n- **November:** Solana Breakpoint 2022, Github Codebase, GitHub Universe 2022, Introducing Notion AI, FTX Crashed, AWS re:Invent 2022, Schema by Figma 2022,\n- **December:** ChatGPT, Orbit 1 NFT, Metaverse, Year in Review, Google in Search 2022\n\n### Thoughts List\nOn most of our Dwarves Rewind, we list our thoughts and burning questions each week. Here are some of our favorite ones:\n\n**#12:** For iOS 16, will you be able to restore or downgrade your device without losing data across versions? Ethereum will be different, but what does that mean to you?\n\n**#15:** With the introduction of “Matter” standardized home devices, Tesla’s AI Day, how will these Matter devices and AI work together in our homes? What will the future of technology look like overall?\n\n**#17:** All eyes on Aptos Mainet. While Ethereum has taken a major leap forward following ‘the merge’, challengers like Solana are making inroads with much faster transaction speeds. Do you think Aptos is likely to compete with ETH in the near future?\n\n**#18:** What will be the fate of Twitter’s employees once Musk takes the reign?\n\n**#19:** Meanwhile, some Twitter employees have expressed their desire to be laid off and get severance, and some are concerned that disagreeing with Musk means losing their jobs and packages. Does the fear of losing a job motivate employees to do better or make things worse?\n\n**#20:** Since Hey, GitHub! is an experimental tool, it seems it could reduce the amount of interaction required with a mouse and keyboard. The good news is that at the moment, it's only available when coding within VSCode.\n\n**#21:** Generative AI models are trained on copyright-protected data — is that legal? The question arises because of how generative AI systems are trained, and worked by identifying and replicating patterns in data, like most machine learning software.\n\n**#22:** What other technologies will AWS feature during re:Invent 2022? A passwordless future integrates two thought-provoking concepts—making logins more dependent on your knowledge than your identity, and integrating a login across platforms. Can it work?\n\n**#23:** It's refreshing to hear good news this crypto winter. \n\n- With the issuance of Soulbound tokens, how will the involvement of Japan’s second-largest bank affect the crypto world?\n- Web3 is gaining traction despite the crypto winter. What are the moving factors associated with the sudden rise in interest despite high pessimism?\n\n**#24:** The last week has been abuzz with ChatGPT, for the non-technical friends, it was amazing to see the transcripts. Even though they knew it was an AI (with superhuman response times), they had natural conversations with it as if it were a human. The next step will maybe affect embedded systems. What are the possibilities for the future of AI in IoT?\n\n**#25:** After FTX’s collapse, several cryptocurrency firms have been trying to show that they still hold onto their users' assets. Many people seek auditing companies to give their clients and potential investors third-party assurances.\n\n**#26:** Remember when NFTs were cool and people thought their JPGs were worth millions? All this happened. The immersive internet is already here, in Web 3.0. How much deeper can we go, and how many more phases can we take?\n","title":"Forward Engineering 2022","short_title":2022,"description":"We want to demonstrate and encourage individual and organizational learning, where both gaining and sharing knowledge is prioritized, valued, and rewarded.

Our adventure until now has been incredibly thrilling, with a strong focus on 'LLM in Production.' Now, we shift our attention to a topic that is always important and never outdated: **Fullstack Engineering**.\n\nIn a world where new businesses and product teams are always changing, there is a high demand for engineers who are skilled in many areas and can handle both sides of the development process. The rise of AI-powered development tools has blurred the lines between front-end and back-end development, making it essential for engineers to know a wide range of technologies and methods.\n\n## Tech Radar\nStep into the latest edition of the Dwarves Foundation Tech Radar Report, where we shed light on the technologies steering our engineering team's growth and success. In this report, we illuminate the technologies shaping our path forward, from evaluating new methodologies to embracing tools that amplify our efficiency.\n\n![](assets/august-forward-engineering_(1).mp4)\n\n### Type-safe Server Client Development\u003c/span\u003e\n***Assess***\n\nDevelopers working on Javascript Applications often face the challenge of enforcing type safety between the client and server. One effective solution is to automatically generate an OpenAPI Spec file from server code. This can then be used with the OpenAPI generator to produce a client-side library for making Type-safe API calls to the backend. Our existing workflow has adopted the Type-safe approach using Swagger for API documentation. We aim to upgrade this approach by automating the generation of API methods.\n\n### Large Language Models\n***Trial***\n\nOur journey with [Large Language Models](https://radar.d.foundation/Large-language-model-LLM-60d7f1372aef4e60ae12894bdbafa473) continues to evolve. We are extending our research and learning path for engineers starting out in developing AI, as outlined in this [Engineering Story Map for LLMs](https://dwarvesf.hashnode.dev/an-engineering-story-map-for-llms). Although each engineering story is unique, this map provides a general idea of where one might be in their journey and what lies ahead. We also had a successful experiment with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), despite realizing the challenges in the process of training and fine-tuning models in terms of handling operational, data, and lack of foundational knowledge. More details on the challenges faced can be found in this [article](https://dwarvesf.hashnode.dev/challenges-faced-when-researching-rlhf-with-openassistant).\n\n### PNPM\n***Adopt***\n\nOur team has officially decided to switch to [pnpm](https://radar.d.foundation/pnpm-198b80c6b5444f8cb1d11392ddc2bf63) as our primary package management tool. After careful evaluation, we found that pnpm is widely embraced by the development community and has been successfully used by great teams at Vercel, Nx, and Chakra UI. Previously, we were using Yarn V1 classic, but as our projects grew, we faced challenges with disk space and slow installations. To streamline our development workflow, we explored pnpm and conducted thorough tests. The results were promising, proving pnpm to be efficient and reliable. Now, we have successfully migrated all major internal tools to pnpm, and it's already making a positive impact on our development speed and productivity. We've also started incorporating pnpm into some client projects. Though we encountered some difficulties with hoisted dependencies in monorepos during the migration process, the overall effort was worthwhile, contributing to our team's enhanced efficiency.\n\n### Qwik\n***Assess***\n\nThe developer world is flooded with numerous frameworks. NextJS, a comprehensive ecosystem and the reference implementation of React, has extensive libraries, documentation, and resources, aspects not paralleled by [Qwik](https://radar.d.foundation/Qwik-e37f4c5cf0ff434ea53c18a2af805864). This makes us skeptical about using Qwik for critical projects in the foreseeable future. However, Qwik's methodology could represent the future of development. It is crucial to understand Qwik's architecture, efficiency secrets, and coding technique implications. One key concept is [Resumability](https://dwarvesf.hashnode.dev/exploring-resumable-server-side-rendering-with-qwik#heading-resumability), which refers to the ability of Qwik applications to resume from a server-side-rendered (SSR) state without the need for hydration. It's not about adopting Qwik entirely, but recognizing its potential influence on stalwarts like React and NextJS. Familiarity with Qwik can provide a pioneering advantage and a fresh perspective on framework dynamics.\n\n### AI-aided development\n***Assess***\n\nIn the software industry, the exploration of rapidly evolving AI tools for code writing support is becoming increasingly common. One compelling use-case is leveraging ChatGPT to generate tests for existing implementations, or even adopting a Test-Driven Development (TTD) approach where the AI drafts the tests before we implement the details. Beyond testing, our engineers have successfully utilized GPT models to generate Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and various UML diagrams, with promising results. While we've experimented with AI for auditing source code, this remains a work-in-progress due to security concerns. Additionally, Copilot has become an invaluable tool in our development workflow, offering next-level autocompletion features that significantly enhance productivity.\n\n## Brainery\n### Growth and Direction\nAs we proceed in our journey of knowledge and skill enhancement, our Brainery continues to bloom with exciting ideas and valuable insights.

However, our perspective shifted significantly after engaging in [a community project](https://github.com/webuild-community/spacebot) aimed at creating a Rust-based game server. This experience opened our eyes to Rust's impressive capabilities. Our developers have come to greatly appreciate the language's speed, safety, and performance.\n\nFurthermore, we've observed that Rust continues to evolve, increasingly supporting a wider array of applications, notably in web development and artificial intelligence. This evolution has motivated us to delve deeper into the language. Our initial steps involve comprehending Rust's concurrency model, which is pivotal for our community project. Simultaneously, we are eager to explore new facets of Rust, expanding our understanding and application of this powerful language.\n\n### Retrieval Augmented Generation\n***Trial***\n\n|          |                                                                         |\n| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Tags     | `#ai` `#llm` `#embeddings` `#llm-knowledge` `#indexing` `#vector-database` |\n| Domain   | `AI` `MLOps` `Indexing` `Semantic Search`            |\n| Projects | `...`                                                                |\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a general technique used to embed knowledge into a Large Language Model (LLM) to be used in lieu of fine-tuning. Instead of using inherited knowledge that was used to train the LLM to retrieve information for the user, RAG takes advantage of LLM embedding models to vectorize semantics into a vector database to be later \"retrieved\" and \"augmented\" as context to \"generate\" new informed outputs for the LLM.\n\nBefore the term was coined, our team has had done several experimentation with this technique with the help of `pgvector` on Supabase on TypeScript deployments, `chroma` on Python deployments, as well as with prompt engineering to further augment context for better indexing. This technique, although coined from development with LLMs, turns out to be a useful indexing technique that can be used as an alternative to keyword-based indexing.\n\n### Self-hosting AI Model in the Browser\n***Assess***\n\n|          |                                                                         |\n| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Tags     | `#ai` `#llm` `#llm-knowledge` `#tooling` `#computer-vision` `#object-recognition` |\n| Domain   | `AI` `Language` `Object Recognition`            |\n| Projects | `...`                                                                |\n\nYOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm designed for object detection, image classification, and instance segmentation tasks. It is the latest iteration in the YOLO family of models, which are known for their speed and accuracy in real-time object detection. Key features of YOLOv8 include:\n\n- **Decoupled head with anchor-free detection**: This improvement allows for more accurate and efficient object detection.\n- **Mosaic data augmentation**: This technique helps improve the model's performance by creating new training samples through various transformations.\n- **Ease-of-use**: YOLOv8 is easy to implement through a user-friendly package, allowing users to quickly integrate it into their projects using the CLI and Python IDE.\n\nWe've been applying YoloV8 as part of our effort in self-hosting AI models in the browser. One of our notable demos is object detection on reCaptcha and creating a basic flow to automate reCaptcha as a fun way to bypass captchas.\n\n![](assets/2023-december-forward-engineering_forward-engineering-december-2023-20240119155936091.webp)\n\n### Passkeys\n***Assess***\n\n|          |                                                                         |\n| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Tags     | `#security` `#authentication` `#passkey` `#authorization` |\n| Domain   | `Security` `Authentication`            |\n| Projects | `...`                                                                |\n\nPasskeys are a new type of login credential that allow users to access online accounts without having to enter a password. They are FIDO credentials stored on a user's computer or phone and provide a more secure way to sign in. Passkeys offer several advantages over traditional passwords:\n\n- **Security**: Passkeys use public key cryptography and are resistant to online attacks like phishing. They are also less susceptible to data breaches and hacking attempts.\n- **Ease of use**: Users can sign in to apps and websites using their device's biometric sensor (such as a fingerprint or facial scan) or a screen lock PIN. This eliminates the need to remember and manage multiple passwords.\n- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Passkeys can be used across different devices and platforms, as long as the user is logged in to their account.\n\nOur team has been experimenting with passkeys to provide authentication alternatives for users. We believe there is a ton of convenience in using passkeys as it offers a quick way for users to authenticate themselves without passwords. We've demoed 2 similar implementations using WebAuthn.\n\n![](assets/2023-december-forward-engineering_forward-engineering-december-2023-20240119160907180.webp)\n\n### Building UI Library Practices\n***Trial***\n\n|          |                                                    |\n| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\n| Tags     | `#ui` `#ux` `#best-practices` `#frontend` `#react` |\n| Domain   | `Web3` `Fintech` `Frontend`                        | \n| Projects | `consolelabs/web-foundation` `mochi-web`           |\n\nAlong with making our library [open-source](https://github.com/consolelabs/web-foundation), there has been a lot of advancements making Mochi UI becoming more generally available to our team and reaching towards version 1.0. Extensive effort was made to make sure component designs stay modular and allow integrated foundations set by our designer to be represented as code. User Experience is a key detail we make sure gets ironed out in every component, and has been part of our focus in standardizing the designs on Mochi UI.\n\nWorking through these challenges has given us the opportunity to lay out and consolidate our frontend foundations, showing our efforts through our recent demo workshop. Working with new standards while creating some of our own have promising results in easing developer experience and productivity. It has been an incredible learning experience and we will continue the path to transform into best practices for both our team and the wider community.\n\n## Labs Roadmap\nIn a recent collaborative discussion between key members of the Labs and Consulting teams, we’ve made decisive strides in pinpointing key topics and potential projects for development. Each topic is paired with specific challenges to ensure we engage deeply with the technology, understanding its practical applications. The focal point for the coming month is WebAssembly (WASM), alongside a range of exciting use-cases we plan to implement and demonstrate.\n\n### Currently Researching\n![](assets/2023-december-forward-engineering_forward-engineering-december-2023-20240126104209647.webp)\n\n| Research Topics         | Progress                                                                                                                                                                             | Next Step                                                                                                                                  |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Web Assembly (WASM)     | - Self-hosted a model in the browser with Tensorflow.js + YoloV8 to bypass reCaptcha v3\u003cbr\u003e- Worked with data processing with DuckDB through WASM on the browser and on ObservableHQ | - Continue forward with porting Rust games and running them through WASM\u003cbr\u003e- Process data with DuckDB WASM in a SME dashboard environment |\n| Passwordless            | - Worked on a simple frontend and backend system on handling Passkeys with WebAuthn                                                                                                  | - Implement QR-based login to handle authentication across multiple devices\u003cbr\u003e- Experiment with Magic Links                                                                |\n| Artificial Intelligence | - Introduced a low-code and simple code example of implementing RAG on ChatGPT and local models                                                                                      | - Boilerplate AI and RAG integration on Elixir\u003cbr\u003e- Deploy a Discord bot for recording and transcribing speech with Whisper                                                                                                                                           |\n| Building UI Practices   | - Demoed a workshop on Mochi UI, encompassing techniques and API composition across components                                                                                       | - Iron out practices and have Mochi UI to be GA                                                                                                                                           |\n\n## Dwarves Rewind - Discord Community\nDwarves Rewind this month will be a collection of tech interests we see happening in our Discord community. Along with our labs roadmap, the community have also shown more interest in Elixir and scalability, with a look on some old and new tools for web development. Some of the programming languages, tools and frameworks discussed this month are:\n\n1. **Actor Model**:\n   https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/p/actor-model\n   https://underjord.io/unpacking-elixir-the-actor-model.html\n   The Actor Model is a style of software architecture in which the basic computational unit is called an actor. It is a conceptual model for dealing with concurrent computation, defining general rules for how the system's components should behave and interact with each other. It has been been trending with our community and labs team, and we're investigating tech that include Actix in Rust and native processes in Elixir.\n   \n2. **Wasp Full-stack Framework**: https://wasp-lang.dev/\n   Wasp is a full-stack framework packaged as a custom programming language to template models, routes, pages, queries, and actions. Wasp takes an explicit approach in bridging and scaffolding the frontend, backend, and deployment layers through a compiler that compiles Wasp into associated files, such as JSX, docker, Prisma, etc.\n   \n3. **Biome**: https://github.com/biomejs/biome\n   Biome is a performant toolchain for web projects, it aims to provide developer tools to maintain the health of said projects. It is a fast formatter and linter for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and JSON, with high compatibility with Prettier. \n\n4. **WebAuthn**:\n   https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-modernized-mfa-with-webauthn\n   https://webauthn.wtf/\n   WebAuthn (short for Web Authentication) is an API specification that enables applications to use strong and secure authentication methods for user registration and login. It provides a way for end users to authenticate themselves using hardware- or software-based authenticators, such as USB security keys or secure hardware elements integrated with a laptop or mobile device, instead of relying solely on passwords.

We continue to chart our course through this vast expanse, driven by a mission to remain at the forefront of our industry and deliver unparalleled value to our clients. In this month's report, we reflect on our achievements and share our visions for the future, focusing on a central theme: \"**LLM in Production**\".\n\n## Tech Radar\nOur engineering team strides into June with a sharp focus on realizing the operational potential of Large Language Models (LLM). Our progress in May has bolstered our confidence in the immense capabilities these models hold, and now we shift our attention towards bringing these tools to life in real-world applications. Alongside this primary pursuit, we also keep an eager eye on the integration and exploration of reinforcement learning from human feedback, and continue our assessments of technologies like prompt engineering, Vector Database, React Server Component, and Zod. As always, we strive to adapt and evolve with the fast-paced technology landscape, and remain steadfast in our commitment to delivering exceptional value to our users and addressing our business needs with agility and innovation.\n\n### Large Language Models\n***Assess***\n\nOur exploration into **[large language models](https://radar.d.foundation/Large-language-model-LLM-60d7f1372aef4e60ae12894bdbafa473)** continues with renewed vigor this June. As we delve deeper into their potential applications through various experiments, we're broadening our understanding of their capabilities. The broad range of uses for these models in real-world applications continues to impress us, further reinforcing our focus on this domain.\n\nHowever, with these new developments come new challenges. We're working diligently to ensure that these models can handle a variety of use cases when integrating them into real products. Key hurdles we're addressing include ensuring the accuracy of the generated content, keeping latency low for real-time interactions, and managing the costs associated with running these models.\n\nWhile these challenges present a steep learning curve, they also provide us with the opportunity to innovate and optimize. By addressing these issues head-on, we're not just seeking to make effective use of large language models, but also to refine the way we interact with them, leveraging their capabilities to their full potential while managing the operational challenges. As we move forward, our focus remains on making these models work for us and our users, striking a balance between potential and practicality.\n\n### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\n***Assess***\n\nWe are starting to explore **[Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://radar.d.foundation/Reinforcement-Learning-from-Human-Feedback-ea2a96254aa845d68b03053e6cf1b454)** (RLHF). This technique, which involves training models using feedback from human interactions, has the potential to make our AI systems more responsive and user-centric. Our aim is to understand the dynamics of RLHF and integrate this approach into our AI applications, thereby enhancing the precision and relevance of our models' outputs.\n\n### Prompt engineering\n***Trial***\n\nAs we continue our journey with **[Prompt engineering](https://radar.d.foundation/Prompt-engineering-9739ebfed76f4cff901cb46155d0bf23)**, we are exploring [self-refinement prompts](https://brain.d.foundation/Engineering/AI/LLM%27s+Accuracy+-+Self+Refinement) that allow an existing model to improve its own output, enhancing its effectiveness over time. Despite its benefits, we're mindful of potential vulnerabilities, particularly from adversarial prompts via techniques like prompt injection, which could pose risks to LLM applications. To mitigate these risks, crafting well-structured prompts is still an effective defense tactic. Our commitment remains to leverage and enhance prompt engineering to create safer, more efficient, and contextually precise AI systems.\n\n### Vector Database\n***Assess***\n\nOur experimentation with the **[Vector Database](https://radar.d.foundation/Vector-Database-dcf2259eb65d4b81a84c4882a8f0c0d6)** reveals new dimensions for its application in our work. As the database can assess the semantic similarity of words and suggest similar text, it serves as an ideal companion for our large language models (LLMs). By harnessing a Vector Database, we can augment LLMs, such as the GPT-4 model, with long-term memory. This augmentation goes beyond model training to include data from our vector database, allowing us to fine-tune and customize prompt responses with more context derived from relevant documents. Techniques like [query caching](https://brain.d.foundation/Engineering/AI/LLM+query+caching) further leverage the Vector Database's capabilities, accelerating the performance of our LLM applications at a lower computation cost. These advancements are not only streamlining our workflows but also enriching the outcomes, promising exciting developments as we move further into the integration of Vector Database.\n\n### React Server Component\n***Assess***\n\nAs we evaluate **[React Server Components](https://radar.d.foundation/React-Server-Component-68a4a526527f44c0997b084e96b99e47)**, their flexibility stands out. Diverging from the traditional client-side rendering approach of Single-Page Applications, RSCs allow us to decide where to render components based on their purpose. By deconstructing the page into smaller components, it becomes clear that many non-interactive elements can be rendered on the server as Server Components. This approach not only improves performance and reduces the bundle size but also enhances the initial page loading time, a crucial factor in user experience. As we progress, our focus is on harnessing the potential of RSCs to build fast, efficient, and user-friendly web applications.\n\n### Zod\n***Trial***\n\n**[Zod](https://radar.d.foundation/Zod-f166f3a065f949f58b5936b34236ca3c)** is a robust, TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. Its primary strength lies in the elimination of duplicative type declarations, as Zod allows developers to declare a validator once, from which it automatically infers the static TypeScript type. It also offers a concise, chainable interface, and functional approach emphasizing parsing over validation. Despite its high functionality, Zod is remarkably compact with zero dependencies and compatibility across Node.js and modern browsers. Its immutable nature ensures that methods like `**.optional()**` return a new instance, and it's equally capable with plain JavaScript. With its notable advantages, we're exploring Zod as a potential replacement for [Yup](https://radar.d.foundation/Yup-9045f94c344c4c1e9b4b941cd43fb50d), seeking to incorporate this developer-friendly tool into our workflows.\n\n## Brainery\n### Growth and Direction\nAs we proceed in our journey of knowledge and skill enhancement, our Brainery continues to bloom with exciting ideas and valuable insights.

As we continue to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, we remain steadfast in our commitment to seeking out the latest technologies and practices to deliver exceptional results.\n\nWith our eyes fixed firmly on the future, we've cultivated an engineering culture that values continuous learning and collaboration. Through initiatives like our Tech Radar, Brainery, and R\u0026D challenges, we've created opportunities for our team to learn, grow, and share their knowledge with the wider community.\n\nAs we look back on the past month, we're excited to share our latest engineering report, which highlights our recent achievements, projects, and insights.\n\n## Tech Radar\nMarch marks a shift in our engineering focus, with an emphasis on \"**Scaling up Delivery Performance**\" as the driving force behind enhancing our software delivery pipeline. This strategic approach is aimed at expanding our team's capacity to deliver more features and services, without compromising on quality or stability. To achieve this goal, we are adopting techniques such as blue-green deployment and monorepo. However, to truly unlock the power of these techniques, it is crucial that we cultivate a shared understanding of their benefits and best practices across the organization. By instilling a culture of scalability in our engineering team, we not only accelerate our ability to meet the evolving needs of our business but also foster a stronger commitment to delivering value to our end-users through continuous innovation and improvement.\n\n### Blue-green deployment\n***Trial***\n\nWe recently implemented [blue-green deployment](https://hashnode.com/edit/clfuzxx9z000d0amk95je906q) for the Mochi Bot application, which offers numerous benefits, including zero-downtime deployments and faster, more frequent releases. With two identical environments, only one is live at a time, allowing new versions of the application to be deployed without any disruption to users. This not only improves user experience but also reduces the risk of downtime-related issues.\n\nOur experience with blue-green deployment has been positive, but there are ongoing research efforts to optimize its configuration for microservices and integrate API testing into the process. Despite this, we believe that the benefits of this deployment strategy, including its cost-effectiveness and practicality, make it a valuable addition to our current infrastructure.\n\n### Monorepo\n***Adopt***\n\nUsing a [monorepo](https://radar.d.foundation/Monorepo-6a57c7c8c7d34d4d8572cd8c2d88fcd6) approach can bring many benefits to teams looking to manage code for multiple projects or modules in a more efficient and streamlined way. This includes managing shared libraries, frameworks, and components across projects, as well as deploying applications more consistently and quickly. Recently, our team in Nghe Nhan faced [challenges](https://dwarvesf.hashnode.dev/from-multi-repo-to-monorepo-a-case-study-with-nghenhan-turbo-monorepo) with managing dependencies and deploying updates across multiple repositories as the project expanded. Coordinating changes between components and maintaining consistency across codebases became increasingly difficult as our engineering team grew. To address these challenges, we decided to migrate to a monorepo structure using [Turborepo](https://radar.d.foundation/Turborepo-0dd18b38468c4859a8beaae7bf6c511c). This decision was prompted by our previous successful experience with monorepo, but to further facilitate adoption and standardize the approach, we also have been working on a template to help our team speed up the process.\n\n### ChatGPT assistance\n***Trial***\n\nThe software development community has engaged in a conversation regarding the potential risks associated with ChatGPT.\n\nDespite the concerns raised, ChatGPT remains a valuable tool for developers seeking to streamline their workflow and increase efficiency. With its capacity to generate code snippets, offer responses to queries, and swiftly create documents, ChatGPT has the potential to enhance productivity. Nonetheless, it is crucial to bear in mind that the accuracy of its responses may not always be 100%, and extensive research may be necessary before utilizing it for more complex tasks.\n\nDespite the possible challenges associated with ChatGPT, some members of our team have begun integrating it into their workflow, such as within VSCode or Raycast.\n\n### Micro-Frontend\n***Assess***\n\nThe concept of [micro frontend](https://radar.d.foundation/Micro-Frontend-81e78d9765eb4b83b6e47639d81dc151) has been the subject of ongoing debates regarding its potential benefits for software development. At our team, we acknowledge that every technology comes with trade-offs. Despite the decrease in discussions about micro frontends, we have observed its continued adoption through our work with clients. For instance, in [a recent case study](https://hashnode.com/edit/clfv0twho000909jw1lyuegjj), we investigated the implementation of Micro-Frontend architecture on an e-commerce platform, analyzing its impact on the system's performance and its ability to streamline the integration of new applications. We found that vertically splitting the apps by sub-domains was an effective approach for the client's specific use case, and their adoption of this approach continues to be successful. Moving forward, our team will incorporate the insights and experiences gained from working with clients on micro frontend solutions to evaluate and integrate them into our practices.\n\n### Delivery metrics\n***Assess***\n\nMeasuring software delivery performance is crucial in the world of software development. One way to gauge team effectiveness is by tracking the number of story points completed and the time it takes to finish them. It is surprising how much project status can be inferred from these numbers, prompting us to ask critical questions and celebrate successes. Our team has also found value in utilizing [DORA metrics](https://radar.d.foundation/DORA-metrics-6b555bcdb782480e80504ff122d6f4c7), which provide further insight and facilitate the development of new practices to enhance productivity.\n\nIt is essential to remember the ultimate intention behind any metric and use them as tools for reflection and learning. Keeping this in mind will help teams stay on track and continuously improve their software delivery performance.\n\n## Brainery\n### Growth and Direction\nWe have been shifting our focus towards **Meaning, Mastery, and Autonomy**, (MMA). We are aiming to create a culture where our everyone can find purpose and fulfillment in their work, where they can develop their skills and talents, and where they have the freedom and responsibility to make decisions.\n\nThis has reflected in our Brainery, where we see much more concise writing from our contributors on areas for work delivery, high-level system concepts, and foundational knowledge.\n\n### Trending Tags\nA summary of some trending tags we see in our Brainery.

As an innovative software firm, we found that the foundations surrounding innovative software were also vital to realizing their prospects.\n\nBelow are some of the common problems we’ve begun more critical research and exploration on:\n\n### Common problems\n* **Multi-tenancy**: With the need for personalized development for each customer of software as a service services, the system design and application architecture need to be designed intelligently to optimize costs as well as efficiency. results, data security. The real multi-tenancy problem is encountered a lot and depending on the system, it will be implemented in different ways. We will offer total solutions to help customers have the best cost and efficiency.\n* **Distributed Concurrency over a single database**: Concurrency control is a crucial aspect of developing applications that can handle multiple user requests simultaneously. It is not uncommon for multiple users to access the same data at the same time in SQL, such that it requires concurrency control techniques over the whole application.\n* **zkEVM layer 2**: The overall design of zkEVM layer 2 blockchain follows the State Machine model and thus emulates the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and **high performance and scalability**, with the aim of providing the same user experience as in Ethereum. In addition to enabling ERC20 token payments and transfers, users can now run Ethereum smart contracts on it.\n\nThis year, we’ve completed two of our challenges, **Query Database 500M Records** and **Locale on Web and Mobile**. This was a concern spanning across our DevOps, Management, and Engineering domains. We’re proud to list it as our completed challenges:\n\n### Completed challenges\nQuery Database 500M Records, Filter Multiple Table: Querying larger datasets invites performance issues and complexity. Our research elaborates techniques for optimizing queries through caching strategies and approaches in cluster architecture.\n\n* **Locale on Web and Mobile:** Locale is a rather subtle issue that encompasses many aspects required for a multilingual application.

Here are some of our most recent ones:\n\n**#27:** We are not sure what Google is going on about since they literally shut down their rival gaming service to xCloud. But Nvidia is different because you use their cloud streaming service to stream games that you actually own from other PC platforms, what we can see can why Nvidia may not actually oppose the deal.\n\n**#28:** Everyone is using ChatGPT. Since its launch, more than 100 million people have signed up for the app and set a record for the fastest-growing user base. As for whether chatbot will kill a job in the future, the way AI is implemented and how society adapts to its integration will ultimately determine its net impact on employment.\n\n**#29:** If tech companies won't make as much money from selling links via search results, will they try to sell information gleaned from our interactions with search chatbots? But we all know it is an important space to keep an eye on to see how marketers can leverage it for their brands and how they utilize these features to better connect with their customers and users.\n\n**#30:** zkEVMs is a scaling solution that allows blockchain networks to process transactions on Layer 2. The launch of the zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine beta mainet is viewed by many as a significant turning point, as it will bring huge improvements to cryptography and blockchains.\n\n**#31:** Artificial intelligence is going mainstream. We want to hear from you about what's getting your attention in the field, so share your thoughts in the comments below and let us know which AI topic has piqued your interest the most.\n\n**#32:** The release of Next.js 13.2 has brought some changes to the way Route Handlers work. While it's positive that Route Handlers no longer need if statements for each method type, some users find the new app directory structure somewhat inconvenient. The mixing of the API folder with other items in the app directory can make it challenging to find a specific route.\n","title":"Forward Engineering March 2023","short_title":"March 2023","description":"As we look back on the past month, we're excited to share our latest engineering report, which highlights our recent achievements, projects, and insight in March 2023.","tags":["engineering","performance","updates","forward-engineering"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh","monotykamary","innno_"],"date":"Mon Apr 03 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"updates/forward-engineering/2023-march.md","slugArray":["updates","forward-engineering","2023-march"]},{"content":"\nThe technological landscape is vast, brimming with opportunities for exploration and growth. As we stand on the brink of May, we pause to reflect on our journey thus far and chart our course forward. In this month's report, we bring you the fruit of our endeavors and the promise of our vision.\n\n## Tech Radar\nAs we advance into a new phase, our engineering team is setting its sights on a new strategic focus - \"Exploring Large Language Models (LLM)\". This shift, at the heart of our product development and business intelligence initiatives, aims to enhance our ability to work with AI-driven language models, allowing us to offer improved user interactions, more personalized product suggestions, and better business understanding. In tandem with this, we are implementing a robust automation framework leveraging Codecept and Playwright, to automate tasks, refine workflows, and maintain high-quality standards. \n\nConcurrently, we're assessing the potential of Radix UI to help us develop highly intuitive, accessible user interfaces. While these advancements in automation and UI development play a vital role, our primary emphasis remains on the exploration of LLMs, a venture we believe will bolster our position at the cutting edge of technological innovation. Our May journey embodies our commitment to continual learning, delivering exceptional value to our users, and meeting our business needs with agility and innovation.\n\n### Large Language Models\n***Assess***\n\nIn our exploration of [large language models](https://radar.d.foundation/Large-language-model-LLM-60d7f1372aef4e60ae12894bdbafa473) (LLMs), such as GPT-3/GPT-4/ChatGPT, Poe, and Claude, we recognize the vast potential these models hold. As we continue to refine our interactions with these models, we aim to harness their capabilities to generate accurate outputs. While we have delved into model fine-tuning, the current costs prevent us from achieving the desired results. However, we remain optimistic about future developments and maintain our focus on utilizing foundation models rather than training our own, considering the high infrastructure costs and the need for quality data. We remain committed to identifying and capitalizing on opportunities to develop useful software applications built upon the power of LLMs, dedicating our energy to learning and expanding our expertise in this promising domain.\n\n### LangChain\n***Assess***\n\nWe have recently begun exploring the [LangChain](https://radar.d.foundation/LangChain-181262b7994c4b108ecf559411dc988e) framework in our AI application development workflow. Designed specifically for building applications that leverage large language models (LLMs), LangChain offers a suite of features like prompt management, chaining, data augmented generation, and agent systems for action sequencing, which collectively streamline the AI development process. As we integrate LangChain into our workflow, we have observed its potential for improving the management and utilization of LLMs, enhancing our interaction with language models, improving the generation of contextually relevant responses, and providing better control over AI behavior. This addition has broadened the spectrum of AI applications we can build, encompassing everything from customer service chatbots and content generators to advanced data analysis systems. However, we are still in the assessment phase, incorporating LangChain into smaller, non-critical projects to fully understand its capabilities and limitations.\n\n### Prompt engineering\n***Assess***\n\n[Prompt engineering](https://radar.d.foundation/Prompt-engineering-9739ebfed76f4cff901cb46155d0bf23) is an innovative field within generative AI, aimed at enhancing the outputs of large language models like ChatGPT. We strive to make AI responses more human-like and contextually precise by crafting meticulous prompts. Using prompt engineering, we can improve AI chatbots' effectiveness across various applications and customize AI behavior to meet specific industry needs. It also serves as a tool to test AI limits and contribute to its continuous improvement. Our adoption strategy involves educating our teams about prompt engineering, fostering an environment that supports learning, and gradually integrating it into our AI systems to learn and adapt based on the results.\n\n### Codecept\n***Assess***\n\nRecently, we have assessed [Codecept](https://radar.d.foundation/Codecept-a64f02c731ff4be59a914f1e4ab6de1d) as a powerful testing framework for efficient and effective end-to-end (e2e) testing. With Codecept, we can automate testing and easily manage and debug complex scenarios. Some key advantages include multi-tasking capabilities, simplicity in test writing, support for multiple test frameworks, lightweight modular structure built on CodeIgniter, and detailed reports and logs for effective debugging. With Codecept, we are able to conduct functional testing, acceptance testing, API testing, cross-browser testing, and benefit from comprehensive test reporting. As we adopt Codecept, we see it as the monorepo for Automation Testing, suitable for all projects due to its support for various testing frameworks like WebDriverIO, Playwright, and Cypress. By building an automation framework based on Codecept, we are already implementing it in several internal projects, providing a solution to the challenges of creating project-specific frameworks.\n\n### Radix UI\n***Trial***\n\nIn our continuous pursuit of effective and accessible UI development, we have adopted [Radix UI](https://radar.d.foundation/Radix-UI-13e49d353df1486ca02fbacfd1765f14), a modular and highly customizable library of pre-built components. Its compatibility with other libraries, such as TailwindCSS, enhances our ability to maintain consistent styling across our applications. The library's modular design allows us to construct unique, highly flexible UIs by combining and customizing small, focused primitives. By integrating Radix UI into our workflows, we are able to efficiently develop responsive and accessible user interfaces without the need to design components from scratch. Our adoption of Radix UI was driven by our commitment to enhance accessibility, replacing [HeadlessUI](https://radar.d.foundation/Headless-UI-53cb40046020450594f46a4cb030ef2e), which presented significant accessibility challenges. We have successfully implemented this migration in our [NextJS boilerplate](https://github.com/dwarvesf/nextjs-boilerplate/pull/23), and we're excited about the new possibilities that Radix UI unlocks for us.\n\n## Brainery\n### Growth and Direction\nWe have been shifting our focus towards **Meaning, Mastery, and Autonomy**, (MMA). We are aiming to create a culture where our everyone can find purpose and fulfillment in their work, where they can develop their skills and talents, and where they have the freedom and responsibility to make decisions.\n\nThis has reflected in our Brainery, where we see much more concise writing from our contributors on areas for work delivery, high-level system concepts, and foundational knowledge.\n\n### Trending Tags\nA summary of some trending tags we see in our Brainery. These tags represent what things our contributors are actively thinking about and researching. For this month, we see a stronger focus on LLM and AI topics, but we also see trending tags related to backend and frontend with more focus on foundational topics such as web-design, OOP, SOLID, etc.\n\n![](assets/2023-may-forward-engineering_forward-engineering-may-2023_286f7e7f87cc09dee3370332640b937d_md5.webp)\n\n### Top Contributors and Notes\nEvery month, we collect a list of top contributors, those who have contributed knowledge to our Brainery for this month.

Our goal is to discover strategies to optimize these databases, enhancing user experiences across digital platforms like social networks, streaming services, and e-commerce sites. Our success hinges on contributing valuable insights and innovations in this key area of AI recommender systems.\n\n### Completed challenges\n**Distributed Concurrency over a single database:** \n\nConcurrency control is a crucial aspect of developing applications that can handle multiple user requests simultaneously. It is not uncommon for multiple users to access the same data at the same time in SQL, such that it requires concurrency control techniques over the whole application. Our team has completed this challenge and is currently wrapping up write-ups on the topics.\n\n**Solutions and articles:**\n\n* [https://dwarvesf.hashnode.dev/managing-dataflow-and-sql-database-with-concurrency-control](https://dwarvesf.hashnode.dev/managing-dataflow-and-sql-database-with-concurrency-control)\n* [https://dwarvesf.hashnode.dev/lessons-learned-from-concurrency-practices-in-blockchain-projects](https://dwarvesf.hashnode.dev/lessons-learned-from-concurrency-practices-in-blockchain-projects)\n\n### Keywords for upcoming challenges\nHere are some of the keywords we’re on the watch for where we haven’t specified a problem statement but we expect will manifest challenges in the near future.\n\n* Access control management\n* Security design and DevSecOps\n* AI augmentation\n* Prompt Engineering\n* Design Payment System\n* Vector Database\n\n## Research Narratives\n### Software Design Research Group\nWe’ve held our Software Design research group for just over a year. This month we are continuing our focus to more on topics and concerns for small and medium enterprises, most commonly concerning security, access control, and database models and mechanisms. We have also begun to investigate more frontend and AI topics. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n* **Explicit Locking In SQL DBMS** - An approach on using explicit locks as a concurrency mechanism to handle application control flow with SQL databases.\n* **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** - A battle-proven approach to restricting system access to authorized users. A presentation and discussion on what it is, how it can be modeled, and what use-cases that often arise that demands the need for access systems such as RBAC.\n* **Load balancer** - A load balancer involves hardware and software that distributes network traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed with traffic. This helps to improve the performance and reliability of applications, websites, and other network-based services.\n\n## Dwarves Rewind May 2023\n[Dwarves Rewind](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/dwarves-rewind-6963734647327375360/) is a reading list serving as a collection of news we aggregate weekly.

There has also been some hot annual events this month, with some of the trending topics this month being:\n\n* Andrew Ng \u0026 OpenAI Free Prompt Engineering Course: Renowned artificial intelligence (AI) experts, Andrew Ng from [DeepLearning.ai](http://deeplearning.ai/) and Isa Fulford from OpenAI, have teamed up to offer an exciting new course on prompt engineering, titled “ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers“. The course, which is completely free, aims to help developers better understand the prompts design and implementation for various use cases.\n* Visual Studio Code Day 2023: VS Code Day is Microsoft's annual event, where you'll learn how to elevate your development workflow using the latest and most outstanding features of VS Code.\n* Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior: LLMs just hit a major milestone with the release of the new \"Generative agents\" paper. By using LLMs, generative agents were able to simulate human-like behavior in an interactive sandbox inspired by The Sims.\n\n### Thoughts List\nOn most of our Dwarves Rewind, we list our thoughts and burning questions each week. Here are some of our most recent ones:\n\n**#33:** For sure, GPT-4 long way to go, things are going to change. In general, when selecting a technology for our frontend tech stack, the foremost question we ask is: \"Has this technology achieved a certain level of stability and maturity?\". They all are associated with the relative ease of development and our ability to stay ahead of the competition. \n\n**#34:** It is now possible to build AI-powered applications without having to spend months or years learning the ins and outs of machine learning. LLMs have some general embedded knowledge, but they mainly operate on the context that you give them via prompting. \n\n**#35:** Node.js is improving at a rapid pace, and software is always evolving. We know that the JS community generally suffers from \"If it hasn't been updated in the last year, it's probably broken and not modern enough\" syndrome, but some software actually ends up being \"finished\" and good enough for the task at hand.\n\n**#36:** As with any new technology, it's not without knots. While we acknowledge that prompting skills will continue to play a role, we expect that the ability of LLMs (Language Model Models) to adjust to \"bad\" prompts will surpass our capacity to effectively instruct them.\n","title":"Forward Engineering May 2023","short_title":"May 2023","description":"As we look back on the past month, we're excited to share our latest engineering report, which highlights our recent achievements, projects, and insights in May 2023.","tags":["engineering","performance","forward-engineering","updates"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["thanh","monotykamary","innno_"],"date":"Mon May 22 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"updates/forward-engineering/2023-may.md","slugArray":["updates","forward-engineering","2023-may"]},{"content":"\n**This month**, we have focused on revamping how we learn, familiarize, and work with tech.

Our adventure until now has been for the most part very exciting, with a strong focus on 'Full-stack engineering’ Now, we shift our attention to a topic that is prolific and always true: **Open-source**.\n\nOpen-source has always been the foundation for many hobby projects, learning experiences, startups, and enterprises. It has stayed true to the idea for the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose - originally helping to fix bugs and later accelerating state-of-the-art tech and AI.\n\n## Tech Radar\nStep into the latest edition of the Dwarves Foundation Tech Radar Report, where we shed light on the technologies steering our engineering team's growth and success. In this report, we illuminate the technologies shaping our path forward, from evaluating new methodologies to embracing tools that amplify our efficiency.\n\nThis month has been the month of trying out new and existing tech. We’ve been more eager to get more hands-on to better understand how our tech and research can apply to our projects and our everyday lives.\n\n![](assets/2023-october-forward-engineering_forward-engineering-october-2023_october-forward-engineering_compressed.mp4)\n\n### Type-safe Server Client Development\n***Trial***\n\nAddressing type safety in JavaScript applications, we're trialing an automated OpenAPI Spec generation from server code to ensure consistent data types between client and server. This method, documented via Swagger, enhances development efficiency and reduces errors.\n\nWe've implemented a boilerplate for backend and frontend, demonstrated in our [Next.js boilerplate pull request](https://github.com/dwarvesf/nextjs-boilerplate/pull/38), and are integrating type safety into [our developer training programs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdwQ7upO1AI).\n\nThe next phase involves transitioning our internal tool, Fortress, to a type-safe framework, as outlined in the [\"Migrate Fortress to use Type-safe approach\"](https://earn.d.foundation/Migrate-Fortress-to-use-Type-safe-approach-fb2d4d8551bb44c48be18140026be5fb) proposal. This move is set to enhance application reliability and showcase the benefits of type-safe practices in our operations.\n\n### AI-aided development\n***Trial***\n\nIn the software industry, the exploration of rapidly evolving AI tools for code writing support is becoming increasingly common. This month, during our Frontend Development Course 2023, we saw a lot of promising projects from both our community and our in-house engineers in creating tools like code reviews at a project scale and automation of CV matching, worthy of a small startup. We see a very clear future of what AI can do for us and how it will be integrated within our everyday lives.\n\nTools built from frontend training courses:\n* Code reviewer - [https://github.com/tranduybau/df-final-project](https://github.com/tranduybau/df-final-project)\n* Resume AI - [https://github.com/khoatruong19/df-frontend-final](https://github.com/khoatruong19/df-frontend-final)\n\n### DuckDB\n***Assess***\n\n[DuckDB](https://radar.d.foundation/DuckDB-569aeec23bf34e418daf949228c37d30) is an embedded database management system that is designed for analytical query processing. Despite recent advances to hardware scaling and database software for data lakes and data warehouses, most workloads and use-cases fall within or below 10GB in size. This means analytical workloads can use DuckDB in lieu of a data warehouse to scope reports and analytics, without the hassle between operation and analytics teams. DuckDB may become an invaluable tool, especially as our workloads don’t reach the scale necessary for use of a data warehouse for our needs.\n\n### Devcontainers\n***Trial***\n\n[Devcontainers](https://radar.d.foundation/Devcontainers-eb3d3ded511d4843851f4ceab643e7d9) are a feature of Visual Studio Code that allow developers to use a container as a full-featured development environment. A **devcontainer.json** file in your project tells VS Code how to access (or create) a development container with a well-defined tool and runtime stack. This container can be used to run an application or to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase. Workspace files are mounted from the local file system or copied or cloned into the container. Extensions are installed and run inside the container, where they have full access to the tools, platform, and file system. Developer experience is a growing need in the industry as well as for our use-cases, to bridge the gap to foster full-stack engineers and onboard them as quickly as possible. We’ve implemented this on many of our internal projects, as well as our public GitHub boilerplates:\n* [Frontend Next.js Boilerplate](https://github.com/dwarvesf/nextjs-boilerplate) - Our boilerplate we’ve used throughout the years as well as our main helper for our frontend course of 2023. We’ve updated it to help generate request/response code from OpenAPI and Swagger standards.\n\n## R\u0026D Topics and Challenges\nInnovation continues to drive us forward at R\u0026D.

Apart from Go, Elixir has been our second go-to programming language that we want to make more generally available for our engineers and community.\n\n* **Rust** - Rust has been the de-facto language for workloads that require raw performance without requiring to understand the nuances of memory management. We’ve used Rust over the years for projects like Web3 and would love to expand our journey for more systems and embedded related programming.\n\n* **WASM** - Web Assembly (WASM) has been on and off in the industry, but has proven to be relatively resilient due to it’s output being very close to machine code, offering high performance with low complexity. WASM has been an emerging technology for serverless use-cases as well as embedded databases on the web.\n\n* **Aspect-Oriented Programming** - AOP is a programming paradigm to help separate cross-cutting concerns by being more modular and introducing behavior without modifying much of the code. This approach we’ve used lightly for feature flagging, but see much more potential use for this programming paradigm.\n\n* **Passwordless** - Passwordless authentication, such as passkeys, have been a growing topic for us and the industry as a whole. The notion that the procedure for logins no longer require a password makes software interactions much quicker and more secure as a result.\n\n### New Tools\n* **Google Analytics 4** - GA4 in the recent year has been taking over UA tags ever since its deprecation. We’ve realized there are much more use-cases we can apply with GA4 that isn’t limited to it’s default analytics. This is exciting for us as we can model and clean event data to aggregate on Google Analytics.\n\n- **Passwordless** - Passwordless authentication, such as passkeys, have been a growing topic for us and the industry as a whole. The notion that the procedure for logins no longer require a password makes software interactions much quicker and more secure as a result.\n\n- **IFramely** - IFramely is an embeddable library that helps developers handle different types of URL embeds in a unified way. It provides a simple and consistent API for embedding various types of content, such as videos, images, and rich media, from different sources. iFramely takes care of the complexities of parsing and rendering embedded content, allowing developers to focus on the user experience and integration of external content into their applications.

We invite you to join us as we explore these discoveries and encourage you to freely contribute your own thoughts along the way.\n\n## Tech Radar\n\n![](assets/august-forward-engineering-2024.mp4)\n\n### Dify\n\n**Adopt**\n\n[Dify](https://dify.ai/) is an open-source platform that's making waves by simplifying the development and orchestration of LLM (Large Language Model) applications. With its robust set of tools, developers can create intelligent workflows—from simple agents to sophisticated AI-driven apps—using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) engine. What's impressive is how it makes AI workflow orchestration intuitive and accessible, even if you're not a tech wizard. The drag-and-drop interfaces and clean UX/UI reduce the complexity of building LLM-based applications, enabling rapid prototyping and testing across multiple models.\n\nWe've been using Dify to quickly prototype product ideas by scaffolding agent workflows and testing their output with various models. It's been a game-changer, especially in building workflow automations like a tech summarizer, memo chatbot, or report composer. Its simplicity and flexibility allow us to experiment with different models and agent workflows without getting bogged down by infrastructure concerns.\n\n![](assets/forward-engineering-q3-2024-20240917163024269.webp) _Our engineers have built and experimented with dozens of workflows on our self-hosted Dify server._\n\n### LangGraph\n\n**Assess**\n\n[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph) is an emerging library designed for building stateful, multi-actor applications using large language models (LLMs). It facilitates the creation of agent and multi-agent workflows by leveraging a graph structure. Each node in the graph acts as an agent responsible for specific tasks, and interactions are managed through edges. This approach enhances productivity by letting developers focus on the specialized functions of each node without worrying about synchronizing inputs and outputs.\n\nThe key benefits? Improved visualization and management of complex interactions, division of tasks into manageable sub-problems, and high control over individual agents and their transitions. Despite its promising capabilities, LangGraph is still in its early days. Many techniques and designs are available on GitHub, but it requires further exploration and validation in diverse real-world applications.\n\n### RAG\n\n**Adopt**\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is enhancing AI by allowing it to access and utilize data it was never trained on. This makes it invaluable for companies needing to leverage their own data efficiently. Currently, it's the most cost-effective way for organizations to integrate their proprietary information into AI models. By retrieving relevant documents or streaming the latest data, RAG enhances the contextual understanding of LLM-based applications, thereby improving their performance.\n\nWe mostly use RAG to enrich input contexts, whether by referencing static documents like PDFs or streaming real-time data from the internet. Its ability to integrate seamlessly with existing workflows and improve AI performance without extensive retraining makes it a practical choice. However, challenges like ensuring data quality and managing latency during retrieval need careful consideration. Alternatives like purely generative models lack the dynamic data access capabilities, making RAG a superior choice for many real-world applications.\n\n### LangSmith\n\n**Trial**\n\n[LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) builds on the foundation laid by LangChain, which simplified the prototyping of LLM applications. But LangSmith shifts focus towards production, emphasizing reliability and maintainability. Its standout features include tracing agent workflows for easier debugging and automating testing with dataset creation and evaluators.\n\nWhile its monitoring tools and tracing capabilities are beneficial for scaling and debugging, it's still relatively new, and widespread adoption is still in progress. We've been trying out LangSmith in projects where robust production support is crucial. It's got potential, but it needs further industry validation.\n\n### Cursor\n\n**Assess**\n\n[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) is a fork of VS Code designed to enhance coding with AI while retaining a familiar text editing experience. What sets this IDE apart is its ability to register documents for reference, significantly boosting productivity by generating accurate and contextually aware code—especially when combined with Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\nOur engineers have been testing it out, and the results are promising, particularly in creating templates and skeleton code. The impact is more noticeable at the unit level, making coding more enjoyable and reducing the mental load of syntax and specifics. Since it's an emerging technology, we've placed Cursor in the \"Assess\" category due to its potential to revolutionize coding practices, despite being relatively new and requiring further exploration.\n\n### Devbox\n\n**Trial**\n\n[Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox) is a tool designed to create isolated, reproducible development environments without the need for Docker containers or Nix language expertise. It simplifies onboarding by using a single `devbox.json` file to set up dependencies and environment configurations, avoiding the clutter of global environments.\n\nDevbox addresses common issues like version conflicts across projects and the resource-intensive nature of Docker on Windows/Mac by leveraging native applications built with Nix. It significantly enhances battery life and system performance, but it does require some familiarity with Nix and can present file permission challenges. We're giving Devbox a trial run, especially for teams seeking cleaner, more efficient development setups.\n\n![](assets/forward-engineering-q3-2024-20240917163118424.webp)\n\n_The journey of experimenting with Devbox is documented in [our memo](https://memo.d.foundation/playground/-devbox/)._\n\n### Shadcn/ui\n\n**Trial**\n\n[Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) offers beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable UI components that you can easily copy and paste into your applications. This open-source tool enhances development speed by allowing developers to quickly scaffold UI components. In our recent projects, we saw significant time savings.\n\nInitially, we had concerns about maintaining consistency with a copy-paste model, but our experience proved otherwise. Customization at the Tailwind config level ensures a cohesive theme, and the lightweight nature of the tool keeps applications fast to load and build. While it may lack the comprehensive ecosystem of full-set frameworks like MUI or Chakra, its modularity and potential AI-backed features with [v0.dev](http://v0.dev) position Shadcn as a compelling alternative.\n\n## Highlights on Memo\n\n### AI \u0026 LLM\n\n[**History of Structured Outputs for LLMs**](https://memo.d.foundation/playground/01_literature/history-of-structured-output-for-llms/)\n\nWhy are structured outputs, like JSON, in LLM API endpoints so vital?

According to the report:\n\n\u003e The biggest growth in planned layoffs came in the technology field, with companies announcing 41,829 cuts, the most in 20 months.\n\nSome of the companies announcing cuts include:\n\n- Intel (~15000)\n- Microsoft (~1000)\n- IBM (~1000)\n- Cisco (~5900)\n- Bytedance (~450)\n\nThe increasing trend in layoffs year-over-year is concerning. It suggests that the tech industry's job market instability is not a short-term phenomenon but potentially a longer-term restructuring. This could lead to a reimagining of workforce strategies in tech, possibly emphasizing more contract work or AI-augmented roles.\n\n![](assets/forward-engineering-q3-2024-20240917163259274.webp)\n\n_Source from [https://layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi)_\n\n### The State of Tech Market in 2024\n\nThe broader tech ecosystem, with JavaScript as a prominent example, is experiencing notable shifts in 2024. A tightening job market for software engineers has slowed career progression and increased competition, leading to several key trends across the industry:\n\n- A shift toward \"boring\" technology and monolithic architectures, emphasizing stability over adopting the latest innovations.\n- A surge in Full Stack development, with TypeScript gaining traction as a preferred language.\n- More responsibilities \"shifting left\" to developers, particularly in areas like testing and security.\n\nThe 2024 Stack Overflow survey highlights intriguing data:\n\n- Erlang developers earn the highest median salary at $100,836, followed by Elixir and Clojure developers.\n- AI tools are poised to become integral to development workflows, with 81% of developers expecting AI to assist in documenting code, 80% in testing, and 76% in writing code.\n- While JavaScript remains a dominant language, its median salary has seen a decline.\n\n![](assets/forward-engineering-q3-2024-20240917163336937.webp)\n\n### AI Makes a Real Impact in Programming\n\nAI is no longer just a buzzword; it's making a tangible impact in programming.\n\n![](assets/forward-engineering-q3-2024-20240917163412653.webp)\n\nAs Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, noted:\n\n\u003e In under six months, we've been able to upgrade more than 50% of our production Java systems to modernized Java versions at a fraction of the usual time and effort. And, our developers shipped 79% of the auto-generated code reviews without any additional changes.\n\nOur thought on that:\n\n- This highlights how AI-assisted coding is lowering development costs and replacing tedious tasks. As AI costs become cheaper and open tools become more available, building AI-integrated solutions will become more accessible.\n- We might soon see one-person or small-team businesses becoming the norm, leveraging AI to handle tasks that previously required larger teams. The opportunities are vast for solo makers who can find niche ideas.\n- It's clear that AI is reshaping the programming landscape. Those who can effectively harness AI tools will have a significant advantage. We might even see the rise of \"AI employees,\" where founders proficient in AI lead the way, and AI application skills become a prerequisite in hiring.\n\n### AI companies continue dominating YC batch\n\nAccording to [a Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1fbb9m0/the_rise_of_ai_companies_in_yc/), in the current Y Combinator batch (S24 - Summer 2024), a staggering 72% of startups are focused on AI—a dramatic increase from just 1% in the winter of 2012 (W12). Compared to the crypto trend, AI's momentum is exponentially greater.\n\n![](assets/forward-engineering-q3-2024-20240917163441436.webp)\n\nSome key takeaways:\n\n- AI will be utilized as a filter for data. Whoever owns the best fine-tuned models will gain the advantage in the future.\n- \"AI wrappers\" will become essential middleware software. Every industry will finally have interfaces to interact with AI.\n- As AI becomes accessible to everyone, differentiation will come from other factors—user experience, attention, branding, and distribution channels.\n- As AI's role in automation grows, the workforce will increasingly shift towards AI supervision, prompt engineering, and ethical oversight.\n- Data ownership will become a central competitive battleground, leading to more regulation, strategic acquisitions of datasets, and ethical debates around the use of data in AI training.\n\nIt's evident that AI is not just a trend but a fundamental shift in how businesses operate. The rise of AI-focused startups indicates a significant transformation in the startup ecosystem.\n\n## References\n\n- [Layoffs jump in August while hiring in 2024 is at a historic low, Challenger report shows](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/05/layoffs-jump-in-august-while-hiring-in-2024-is-at-a-historic-low-challenger-reports-shows.html)\n- [What is old is new again](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/what-is-old-is-new-again)\n- [Stackoverflow 2024 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/)\n- [Feeling very powerful as a technical founder with Claude Sonnet 3.5](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1e7rtdw/feeling_very_powerful_as_a_technical_founder_with/)\n- [Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO tweeting about the impact of AI in coding](https://x.com/ajassy/status/1826608791741493281)\n- [The Rise of AI Companies in YC](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1fbb9m0/the_rise_of_ai_companies_in_yc/)\n","title":"Forward Engineering Quarter 3, 2024","short_title":"Quarter 3 2024","description":"In Q3/2024 Forward Engineering, we explore new tech stacks, engineering excellence, and key trends from the tech market over the past three months, with a focus on AI.

The technology we used yesterday may be deprecated today. New technology has enabled us to create new things. With the existing set of problems, new solutions will emerge along with new technologies.\n\nOver five years of working as an innovative software firm, other than the energetic tech-savvy workforce, we shape the team day by day with the core values that move towards the engineering culture. We start this team with the mission to empower innovation and join the force to co-create the future. This urges us to learn the newest and the best technology and new practices out there to enhance the output quality, speed up the development process, also to bring the best pieces of software to life.\n\nWe launch The Dwarves Tech Radar as a living asset to evaluate the adoption decision and keep the technology direction stays on track. Tech Radar is how we do R\u0026D, how we work on self-growth and motivate continuous curiosity.\n\n## Adoption Process\nWhen we observe a new tech, we map to the movement of the certain market to evaluate if the new tech could fit in. The main idea is to see if the new tech could help to make anything better than before in the long run and also serve our development direction.\n\nThe Dwarves are encouraged to gather into small focus groups to discuss and study a particular topic. The below format could be found originated from ThoughtWorks. We organize the topics using two categorizing elements:\n\n* Quadrants represent different kinds of topics.\n* The rings indicate what stage in an adoption lifecycle we think they should be in.\n\n## Quadrants\nThe quadrants consist of:\n\n* Languages and Frameworks, e.g., Erlang, Svelte, R\n* Techniques, e.g., new design technique, software structure, microservices architect.\n* Tools, e.g., editors, databases, software development tools.\n* Platforms, e.g., things provided by others that we build software on top like Vault, Istio, JupyterLab.\n\n## Rings\nOur radar has four rings, start from the middle.\n\n* Adopt: proven and mature for use.\n* Trial: ready for use but not completely proven.\n* Assess: things to explore, look at closely.\n* Hold: things that not fit us or we’ve had a good experience.\n\nFor each batch, we will organize into volume in our github repository (dwarvesf/radar) and track down the changes or comments from the study group.\n\n## The Tech Knowledge Areas\n![](assets/dwarves-tech-radar-the-introduction_8e5f7f8bb132590bfbf3105155047b6c_md5.webp)\n\nAbove is the knowledge areas that we think the software engineers should have been through. Our current tech stack is the reflection of how we apply those theoretical knowledge in real life. Run through the software development lifecycle and engineering disciplines, it mainly cover\n\n* Requirement\n* Design\n* Development\n* Testing\n* Deployment\n* Maintenance / Monitoring\n\nIn each particular topic, there are new practices, tools, frameworks and services that keeps evolving.

Dwarves Tech Radar kicked the initial step since January of 2020. \n\nIt is the first time we sit down and do it in written form. It's a bit hard for the engineers at first, but we managed to complete the volume with ten reports.\n\nBesides volume 01, we have an opportunity to sort out our current technology index and put it at https://d.foundation/radar](https://d.foundation/radar). And for this edition, the theme is to get the whole team used to the concept of a central knowledge base—every study to expand our view to the tech scene counts. The design team also has a place to contribute and discuss their practices.\n\n![](assets/dwarves-tech-radar-volume-01_d6ad0adba1f212243cbd321a44cc2e53_md5.webp)\n\nLet us walk you through the first Volume.\n\n## Language \u0026 Framework\n### WebAssembly\nPreviously, it takes HTML, CSS, and Javascript to perform an interactive web-app for users. But with the continually higher demand, web-app must serve at a better velocity. Web Assembly was created to tackle the performance-critical problem that Javascript is struggling, leveraging the calculating ability in client-server, especially in multimedia processing tasks. The topic is a quick playing-around that will help engineers shorten their time to get to know the WebAssembly concepts.\n\n### Progressive Web App\nNative applications are known for being incredibly productive and reliable. It's fast, convenient, user-friendly, and work regardless of network connection and can be considered part of the device it's run on. Given this noticeable feature, PWA is an enhanced technique built with modern APIs. PWA equips web-app with native-like capabilities, reliability, and installation while reaching anyone, anywhere, on any device with a single codebase. In short, it supports and provides users with a unique opportunity to upgrade their web experience.\n\n### Three.js\nThree.js is a library that is used to create and display 3D animation in web applications. Comes with a short demo on how to turn music audio files into sound waves using three.js and WebAudio API, this topic can be considered a self-project from one of our front-end Dwarves, applying the basic concept of three.js and use it for audio visualization.\n\n### Istio\nIstio is an excellent choice for service mesh due to its amazing and useful feature set. Service discovery, traffic management, service-to-service, and origin-to-service security, observability (including telemetry and distributed tracing), rolling releases, and resiliency.\n\nStill, our infrastructure scale is far from utilizing all of those functions. Given that reason, Istio is quite complex and resource-consuming to adopt. We've decided to hold its implementation in the time being.\n\n### SwiftUI\nSwiftUI is a UI framework that lets developers create apps in a declarative way. There are minimal code changes as a lot of the same components on SwiftUI can be reused. Learn once \u0026 apply anywhere, SwiftUI Stacks, Control, and Layouts work the same with mini changes and navigation. Most controls and data work across all platforms and will be automatically translated to the user.\n\nSwift UI is still in its early stage and not yet mature to apply for any production scale. But we think it will be kicked in on iOS 15. To make sure we can be all ready by then, we are using it for our internal projects and exploring the new iOS features, like Widget and so on.\n\n### XPC Service\nRunning an application needs more than one processor. It takes support from other process helpers. This makes sure the app can still run once one of the process helpers is crashed; leave the minimum of memory footprint and enhancing security. Acts as an inter-process-communication mechanism, XPC Service manages the communication between the processors and the application by calling the processors in the time of need and turned off once the process is done.\n\nApplying XPC-service in mobile development touches some advantages: reduce memory footprint or separated permission for each service. But on the other hand, it triggers the coding boilerplate and the latency between some specific services.\n\n## Practices \u0026 Approach\n### Software Reusability\nSystems are repeatedly created in a specific field, with set variables to fulfill the requirements. Instead of rebuilding these systems every time a product is made, reusability in software is how developers shorten the effort by re-picking the elements from the previous system. This topic is a brief explanation of why we opt for frameworks in the development process or why web service standards are being used widely. It's also the answer for some software matters such as lower software production and maintenance costs, faster delivery of systems, and increased software quality to get the final goal is the increment of return on software investments.\n\n### CLI Assistant\nDuring the coding process, we realize people will soon forget about the code information. It happens every once in a while. The most usual scenario is to switch to the browser and Google the hell out of it. This terminal assistant is a heuristic-approach tool to provide the knowledge we need in the software process. Combining with a rubber duck for debugging, CLI Assistant helps reduce the effort to search for answers constantly, as it manages to contain the info we need along the way.\n\n### Gestalt UI Principles\nUser Interface isn't only about aesthetics. It's also about usability, performance, and how users experience the product along the way.\n\nGestalt Principles will be an active supporter for us during our UI design process. Before we fully understand UI's beauty and how to create it, those principles are our guidance.\n\nHowever, never limit yourself to any line or principles. Rules are subjected to be broken. Feel free to stay creative. A great UI design is a harmonious combination of accessibility, feasibility, and art.\n\n### Go-routine Underlying\nGo's native concurrency model allows it to rise in popularity for creating truly concurrent systems. Goroutines, in fact, acts as a vital part of its functioning. They are the heart and soul of the language and can provide a massive performance boost if used appropriately.\n\n### Applied Security Aspects in\n* SSH\n* SSL\n* Blockchain\n\nFrom the dawn of the network until now, security has always been essential. But as time goes by, security is embedded into frameworks and low-level level layers of the tech stacks. Hence, many developers spend their time messing around with the top-level level layers, confident that the security issues are covered by frameworks \u0026 libraries. Security somehow is placed in a black box, and we are gradually getting ignorant about how it works. This explains the underlying security principles of Blockchain and SSL (Secure Sockets Layers), providing the foundation of how to put the security into action.\n\n### AARRR Funnel\nWith AARRR funnel, we could build a product based on a concrete foundation and minimize the risks by defining what it takes to get the business goal and how to get there (metrics).\n\nAlong the way, we could define the metrics for each stage and which one deserves the utmost focus. It creates our ability to do things in the right way.\n\n### Blockchain for Designer\nThe key value proposition of Blockchain is to provide users with transparency and efficiency. Many businesses take off by applying Blockchain, especially in finance, supply chain, healthcare, and gaming. Blockchain is believed to help users resolve trust issues when it comes to personal information and assets.\n\nThus, design for Blockchain is the most critical challenge for raising adoption. Effective UX design is essential to create useful and valuable applications. This keeps end-users comfortable and, eventually, forget about the sophisticated underlying technology.\n\nAlthough Blockchain will change and develop in the future, the principle remains the same. That means product designers must always stay posted on new Tech that can become a savior for users' pain points.\n\n### Remote UX Testing\nThanks to the usability test, we were able to address the user's trouble. It lets us improve the information architecture and visual hierarchy and product performance to bring users a better experience. This reduces their effort and time to the minimum, which, in return, should drive more sales.\n\nAs we have no idea when the Covid-19 pandemic is over and work from home is strongly recommended, it's the right time to adopt remote methods in UX design, including Remote Moderated Usability Testing. Although there are some drawbacks, it's still a good solution for our team, client, and test participants.\n\n## Reaching Toward\nThese above are just the beginning of a long run. We're thinking of bringing everything alive once all the topics are wrapped up. In the meantime, we'd love to receive all of the comments, contributions, and advice to make this Radar more completed. The best can always become better.\n\nThough this began as a side project, The Dwarves Tech Radar speaks up the code that sticks us together for over the years.\n\n**Innovation** - the urge to discover new ways of solving the current problems and create impacts\n**Craftsmanship** - the mindset of dedicating your time and effort in every piece of work\n**Teamwork** - the spirit of connecting and collaborate effectively amongst the crew without breaking the present value.\n\nInnovation happens almost every day, and it's our job to pursue the latest version. It's what sets the business successful and giving them a competitive advantage. That begins with nothing but keeps the employee updated on the latest development.\n\nGrab a seat and stay abreast of our latest topic updates.\n","title":"Dwarves Tech Radar Volume 01","short_title":"Tech Radar Volume 01","description":"For this edition, the theme is to get the whole team used to the concept of a central knowledge base—every study to expand our view to the tech scene counts.

Road to a wider and more diversified rings, Dwarves Tech Radar v2 contains the practices to **simplify the workflow**, new techniques/ approach methods to **upgrade our current standards** and **expand the domain knowledge.** \n\n## Trial\n### Earthly: The combination Dockerfile + Makefile\n[https://earthly.dev/](https://earthly.dev/)\n\nA repeatable syntax builds to untangle the debugging process between the local environment and the CI platform. Earthly allows our DevOps to merge all the tools into one \"Earth\", and eventually simplify the whole CI/CD flow. As DevOps must integrate different files from both Makefile and Dockerfile for integration testing, Earthfile was created to remove this burden, automatically. Reproduce CI failures is also what makes Earthly more valuable. This enables developers to run CI on their local env, instead of the constantly `git commit -m \"try again\"`.\n\nWe applied it on Voconic, our complex on-going project about Cloud platform, to fully utilize the benefit. Earthly executes targets in parallel and makes our pipelines run much faster.\n\n![](assets/dwarves-tech-radar-volume-02_ecb87e89c8fcfad298cc445cb3c4c76b_md5.webp)\n\n## Assess\n### Webflow: Build visual canvas without coding techniques\n [https://webflow.com/](https://webflow.com/) \n\nAt some point, we figure the development phase might take more time and resources than we need. Therefore, a no-code platform is what can resolve the issue. Webflow removes the usual misunderstanding between designers and developers - enables them to convert stunning designs into production without any coding techniques. \n\nDuy P, our UI designer, approached this with KiwiPay: [https://kiwipay.webflow.io/](https://kiwipay.webflow.io/)\n\n![](assets/dwarves-tech-radar-volume-02_3306d8d315bae18a20786c33778c2b25_md5.webp)\n\nBesides the outstanding points: Sharing for multiple collaborators, easy working flow, codebases can be exported easily in HTML/ CSS \u0026 JSON data, Webflow still has its downside. The no-code mechanism prevents Webflow from performing complex animation, i.e., generates a limitation in the animated web. Furthermore, unstable responsiveness and errors in image display are things Webflow needs to work on.\n\n### Volta: Hassle-free JS Tool Manager\n[https://volta.sh/](https://volta.sh/) \n\nDuring our work with Javascript, each project comes with different node versions. Usually, managing these versions relies mostly on nvm, requiring developers to manually run their CLI every time switching between projects. It's a waste of time and can quickly cause errors.\n\nOne of our engineers started to work on Volta - a hassle-free approach to manage the CLIs. In short, Volta detects the node versions in the JSON package, unifies them into one place, and automatically switch them as developers change their projects. Since Volta supports quick engine setup, we get to install the npm package binaries into the toolchain once and for all and then let Volta take care of the rest.\n\n## Adopt\n### Upptime: Real time status update \n[https://upptime.js.org/](https://upptime.js.org/)\n\nWe tried out CState as our monitoring service, but CState requires low level setup at infrastructure level and therefore not suitable for our bootstrapping kit. Upptime, on the other hand, only requires a simple Github repository and a config file to get it started. We gave Upptime a twist, and rolled out our version at [stt.daf.ug](http://stt.daf.ug/).\n\n![](assets/dwarves-tech-radar-volume-02_3b5bb41a5a96a78fadb9fef60f1d0c24_md5.webp)\n","title":"Dwarves Tech Radar Volume 02","short_title":"Tech Radar Volume 02","description":"Dwarves Tech Radar v2 contains the practices to simplify the workflow, new techniques/ approach methods to upgrade our current standards and expand the domain knowledge.","tags":["radar","forward-engineering","technology"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["duy"],"date":"Thu Jan 14 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"updates/forward-engineering/tech-radar-volume-02.md","slugArray":["updates","forward-engineering","tech-radar-volume-02"]},{"content":"\nWe started [the 1st volume](https://github.com/dwarvesf/radar/tree/master/vol-01) a year ago, mostly about assessing all the tech indexes we have adopted for 5 years. Then we moved to [the 2nd volume](https://github.com/dwarvesf/radar/tree/master/vol-02), where we figured ways to simplify the workflow and complete our project toolkit.\n\nAnd here we go again, another version of tech radar at Dwarves Foundation. 2021 has just gone through its first quarter, and we've left with some new toys to trial and see if they create any impact. In short, this 3rd volume is all about one thing: **Trial**.\n\nWe also have the GitHub version at **[dwarvesf/radar/vol-03](https://github.com/dwarvesf/radar/tree/master/vol-03)**.\n\n## Testing\n### [k6]()\n*[https://k6.io/](https://k6.io/)*\n\n![](assets/dwarves-tech-radar-volume-03_4d92977a7295c51f3e0fdd3d3966aedd_md5.webp)\n\nOpen-sourced load testing tool to verify the system's loading tolerance. By applying k6, developers can measure the limited amount of requests that the system can handle.\n\nThough k6 is written in Go, its scripts are made out of Javascript. Thanks to its code-driven mechanism, with the powerful code-based scripting from JS, k6 was built to prioritize developers. It's easy to maintain and integrate k6 with the daily tools of developers, like GitHub, Grafana, VSCode, GraphQL.\n\nSince functional testing is still our main work, Quynh Le - our QC Team Lead, decided to take a good look at it as a reference before moving to Testlink.\n\n### [Testlink]()\n*[https://testlink.org/](https://testlink.org/)*\n\nAfter k6, Testlink is the next thing on queue - An open-sourced test management tool that oversees and controls everything in test, test cases, test report, requirement, or test execution. We hosted a radio talk on this, mainly to demo the team on how we set up and apply Testlink into our current testing workflow.\n\nCurrently, we're trialing Testlink with BaseHQ and Aharooms. We get to know the project quality status or how many percentage requirements are covered by using it. The plan is to configure and sync the automation test report with TestLink and task report tools such as Jira.\n\n## Front-end Development\n### [Preact]()\n*[https://preactjs.com/](https://preactjs.com/)*\n\nA JS library developed on React structure, with the same API, component and virtual DOM integration. Thanks to the light bundle size (3kb), the Preact-based website is faster in rendering and boosting user experience. The next level for React alternative and the smallest library in size so far.\n\nProviding the same APIs and mechanism as React, Preact can be used directly in the browser and doesn't require any build or tools. Using `preact-compat` in Webpack/ Browserify, developers create an alias to achieve 100% compatibility with React.\n\nA significant advantage of switching to Preact from React is the smaller bundle size that helps the app to load faster - this can be a key requirement for some projects. We're using Preact to bootstrap some projects of the marketplace and product showcases.\n\n## DevOps and Maintenance\n### [ArgoCD]()\nActs as a Kubernetes controller which continuously monitors running applications and compares the current, live state against the desired target state (as specified in the Git repo); ArgoCD helps update, manage and control the code versions during its development phase on k8s. Testers can export the environment configuration in different formats, such as customize files, YAML files or jsonnet.\n\n## No-code Platform\n### [Webflow and Bubble.io]()\nWe did bring up [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) in the previous version and applied it in [KiwiPay](https://kiwipay.webflow.io/) - marking our first attempt in no-code development. Succeeding this, we used Webflow to finetune the website of [ATVPro](https://atvpro.webflow.io/)\n\n![](assets/dwarves-tech-radar-volume-03_178bf3e1958cd514ccb99d9a3b4ce3bf_md5.webp)\n\nAiming for a more complex tool, we dived in [bubble](https://bubble.io/) - a no-code tool with the same concept. After using it for one of our design projects, we realize it somehow refrains developers from learning and adjusting the code. Meanwhile, it requires a deeper level of code and database, making it hard for designers to pick up. That leaves us with hitting a pause on bubble, and sticking with Webflow for our future projects.\n","title":"Dwarves Tech Radar Volume 03","short_title":"Tech Radar Volume 03","description":"In short, this 3rd volume is all about one thing: Trial","tags":["radar","forward-engineering","technology"],"pinned":false,"draft":false,"hiring":false,"authors":["duy"],"date":"Thu Apr 29 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","filePath":"updates/forward-engineering/tech-radar-volume-03.md","slugArray":["updates","forward-engineering","tech-radar-volume-03"]}],"isListPage":true},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...slug]","query":{"slug":["updates","forward-engineering"]},"buildId":"1Xa4jrdKE4wtZ0f9M5143","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
